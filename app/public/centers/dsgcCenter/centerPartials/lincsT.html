      The overarching goal of the Broad Institute’s LINCS program is the development of
      comprehensive signatures of cellular states that can be used by the entire
      research community to understand protein function, small-molecule action, physiological
      states and disease states. Our center will create the world’s most comprehensive
      resource of perturbational signatures. This will include 1.4 million L1000
      genetic (CRISPER knock-out, shRNA knock-down and ORF overexpression) and small-molecule
      (drug and tool compound) perturbations spanning 50 cell types of varied lineage.
      We will make it possible for biologists and computational scientists worldwide
      to interact with the data by creating user-friendly apps that are designed
      to facilitate biological discovery.
