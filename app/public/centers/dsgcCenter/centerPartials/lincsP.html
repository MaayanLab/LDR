      The LINCS Proteomic Characterization Center for Signaling and Epigenetics, under
      the direction of Dr. Jacob D. Jaffe of the Broad Institute, tests the hypothesis
      that early modulation of signaling events in response to perturbations can
      establish new cellular states by altering their epigenetic landscapes. Using
      cutting-edge mass spectrometry-based proteomics assays, the center broadly
      profiles cellular responses in the spaces of phosphosignaling and histone modifications
      (epigenetic “marks”) in a highly multiplexed manner. The center focuses on
      perturbing genes and pathways in foundational biology systems (such as cancer
      cell lines) and in neurobiological cellular differentiation paradigms (under
      direction of co-investigator <a href="http://lihueitsai.org/">Dr. Li-Huei Tsai</a>      of MIT). Next-generation proteomic data acquisition and analysis strategies
      to support these activities are being developed in the laboratory of <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/uw.edu/maccoss/">Dr. Michael MacCoss</a>      of the University of Washington.
