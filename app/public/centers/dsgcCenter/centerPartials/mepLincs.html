      Our goal in this project is to contribute to further development of the NIH Library
      of Integrated Network-based cellular signatures (LINCS) program by developing
      a dataset and computational strategy to elucidate how microenvironment (ME)
      signals affect cell intrinsic intracellular transcriptional- and protein-defined
      molecular networks to generate experimentally observable cellular phenotypes.
      We will infer these regulatory relationships by combining measurements of ME
      perturbagen-induced changes in multiple cellular phenotypes, RNA expression
      and regulatory protein expression in a core set of cell lines with measurements
      of responses of the same lines to chemical and genomic perturbagens made by
      our team in other projects and by other LINCS sites. Our data will complement
      existing perturbagen response LINCS data by providing information on ME perturbagen-induced
      changes and by providing quantitative image based measurements of seven cellular
      response phenotypes plus associated changes in gene transcription and regulatory
      protein expression. Integrative analysis of these data will enable us to address
      four key questions:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>How are ME peturbagen-induced cellular phenotypes regulated by specific molecular
        networks?
      </li>
      <li>Do subsets of ME-induced perturbations elicit common molecular network changes
        and phenotypic responses?</li>
      <li>Do specific molecular network signatures influence multiple cellular phenotypes?</li>
      <li>Are the ME perturbagen-induced network changes similar to the genetic or chemically
        induced network changes identified in other LINCS projects?</li>
    </ol>
