      <strong>Goals</strong>: The overall goal of the HMS LINCS Center is to delineate
      the fundamental principles of cellular response to perturbagens – clinical
      grade kinase inhibitors and components of the cellular microenvironment in
      particular – at the level of single-cells and cell populations and to make
      response data routinely available along with web-based browse, query and programmatic
      tools. The Center develops, tests and applies diverse measurement and computational
      methods and uses these to create response signatures for normal and diseased
      human cells exposed to perturbations individually and in combination. We emphasize
      systematic collection of data not currently available in public databases including
      live and fixed-cell imaging, biochemical data on signaling proteins and multi-factorial
      drug-response phenotypes. In pursuit of this goal, we also help to develop
      metadata standards and informatics systems for these types of data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Approaches</strong>: The collection of multiplex perturbagen-response
      data at HMS involves the use of complementary assays including imaging, flow
      cytometry, sandwich immunoassays, protein mass spectrometry and mRNA profiling
      as a means to measure the levels, localization and states of modification of
      proteins targeted by perturbagens and the networks in which these proteins
      are embedded. Systematic analysis of this data yields the most fundamental
      measure of cellular response to perturbation: the dose-response relationship.
      Construction of perturbagen-response signatures using statistical modeling,
      network inference and machine learning creates models predictive of responses
      by genetically diverse cells to specific perturbations. Customized query, browse
      and explore functions developed in collaboration with the BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination
      and Integration Center, and grounded in established ontologies and standards,
      will make it possible to access HMS LINCS data and manipulate it programmatically.
    </p>

      <strong>Outcomes</strong>: The Center’s research will provide a comprehensive
      picture of the responses of cells and tissues to some of the most important
      classes of therapeutic molecules (kinase inhibitors and chromatin targeting
      drugs) and the extent to which these responses vary with changes in the solid-phase
      and soluble components of the microenvironment. We aim to characterize variation
      in the biochemistry of cell signaling pathways under basal and perturbed conditions
      and then explain the origins of this variation in precise molecular terms.
      By comparing perturbagen-response across tissue types and disease we will not
      only uncover fundamental properties of cell signaling networks, we will identify
      opportunities for drug repurposing. We expect repurposing of cancer drugs for
      cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases to represent a particularly significant
      opportunity. By directly comparing perturbagen-responses in diseased and normal
      cells, including cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, kidney epithelia, neurons, and
      immune cells we will increase our understanding of toxic responses and develop
      means for efficiently scoring the potential therapeutic index of new drugs.
      Finally, by creating predictive models of drug response for different tissue
      niches we hope to improve our ability to personalize therapies to the needs
      of individual patients and to increase the durability of existing treatments.
