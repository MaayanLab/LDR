      Building on a successful pilot project, the National Institutes of Health has awarded
      grants to six research institutions to establish centers, collectively called
      the Data and Signature Generation Centers. The National Human Genome Research
      Institute (NHGRI) and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI),
      both part of NIH, administer the program on behalf of the NIH Common Fund.

    <a ui-sref="dsgcCenter({center: 'DTOXS'})">Drug Toxicity Signature Generation Center (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai)</a>
    <p>
      The Drug Toxicity Signature Generation Center aims to develop cell signatures that
      will predict adverse events that might be caused by drugs and will identify
      other drugs that might lessen these side effects. The center will leverage
      the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System
      database to identify drugs that produce adverse events in heart, liver and
      neuronal function, and to search for drugs that may mitigate these events.

    <a ui-sref="dsgcCenter({center: 'HMS-LINCS'})">HMS LINCS Center (Harvard Medical School)</a>
    <p>
      The HMS LINCS Center develops new measurement methods and computer algorithms to
      detect and analyze perturbations induced by therapeutic drugs in healthy and
      diseased human cells.
    </p>
    <a ui-sref="dsgcCenter({center: 'Broad-LINCS-Transcriptomics'})">LINCS Center for Transcriptomics (Broad Institute)</a>
    <p>
      The LINCS Center for Transcriptomics is studying up to 50 cell types perturbed by
      a large number of chemical compounds and genetic reagents that activate or
      deactivate genes. Each perturbation will produce about 1,000 gene-expression
      readouts. By the project’s end, the center expects to have generated more than
      1 million profiles of how genes are expressed in different cells.
    </p>
    <a ui-sref="dsgcCenter({center: 'Broad-LINCS-PCCSE'})">LINCS Proteomic Characterization Center for Signaling and Epigenetics (Broad Institute)</a>
    <p>
      The LINCS Proteomic Characterization Center for Signaling and Epigenetics studies
      cell disruption at the most basic levels: phosphorylation-mediated signaling
      — that is, how cells communicate internally; and epigenetics, or how cells
      perpetuate non-genetic information as they grow.
    </p>
    <a ui-sref="dsgcCenter({center: 'MEP-LINCS'})">Microenvironment Perturbagen (MEP) LINCS Center (Oregon Health and Science University)</a>
    <p>
      The MEP LINCS Center studies how both malignant and non-malignant cells are controlled
      by the microenvironments in which they live. The researchers will provide measurements
      of the impacts of thousands of different microenvironments on cellular phenotypes,
      protein make-up and gene expression readouts in cell lines.
    </p>
    <a ui-sref="dsgcCenter({center: 'NeuroLINCS'})">NeuroLINCS Center (University of California, Irvine)</a>
    <p>
      The NeuroLINCS Center concentrates on human brain cells, which are far less understood
      than other cells in the body. The researchers believe it will be necessary
      to study these cell types directly to understand the causes of neurological
      disease and to develop new therapies. By applying LINCS-type perturbations
      to studying an array of human brain cells, the researchers hope to identify
      targets for developing drugs against neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s
      disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease),
      spinal muscular atrophy and Huntington’s disease.
