      The LINCS program is implemented in two parts: pilot phase 1 (FY 2010) and the continuation
      of the program in production phase 2. This part of the program consists primarily
      of LINCS Data and Signature Generation Centers. Phase 2 will also synergize
      with the efforts of the <a href="http://bd2k.nih.gov/#sthash.UHtPu2rQ.dpbs">NIH Big Data to
  Knowledge (BD2K) program</a>.

      <h4>LINCS Data and Signature Generation Centers</h4>
      <p>
        The <a ui-sref="dsgc">LINCS Data and Signature Generation Centers</a> are
        six research centers focused on high-throughput experiments that examine
        the changes that occur when a variety of different cell lines are exposed
        to perturbations.
      </p>
      <h4>BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center</h4>
      <p>
        The <a ui-sref="dcic">BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC)</a>        is the data coordination center for the NIH Common Fund’s Library of Integrated
        Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program, which aims to characterize
        how a variety of types of cells, tissues and networks respond to disruption
        by drugs and other factors. The center supports data science research focusing
        on interpreting and integrating LINCS-generated data from different data
        types and databases in the LINCS-funded projects. This center is co-funded
        by
        <a href="http://bd2k.nih.gov/#sthash.UHtPu2rQ.dpbs">BD2K</a> and the
        <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/">NIH Common Fund</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The organizational structure of the Center includes a strong Consortium Coordination
        and Administration (CCA) that supports and manages the Center’s goals and
        deliverables, and coordinates activities across the LINCS and BD2K programs.

      <h3 class="phase-header highlight-secondary">LINCS Pilot Phase 1 (Fiscal Year Completion 2013)</h3>
      <p>
        The <a ui-sref="phaseOne">LINCS Pilot Phase 1</a> was composed of 10 centers:
        two data production/analysis centers, that generated data for the LINCS matrix,
        four centers dedicated to developing technology to complement and facilitate
        the collection of cellular signatures, and four centers that developed computational
        tools for analyzing the data produced by the data production centers. In
        addition, two external supplements, as well as a number of internal collaborations,
        supported and augmented the work done by the LINCS centers.
