    <p class="col-sm-12">This website enables the LINCS Data Signature Generation Centers(DSGCs) to submit their data release instances in a consistent and controlled format. This will facilitate improved data integration, data search, and analysis across the various LINCS resources and datasets. In the future, the data registration system will be applied to the broader systems biology community for the purpose of integrating LINCS data with other major repositories.</p>
