  <h4>Abstract</h4>
  <p>One of the challenges of BD2K is to capture metadata about dataset instances and link such metadata to controlled dictionaries and ontologies. This metadata capture is expected to improve dataset search and facilitate data integration. This challenge is central to the LINCS program and the BD2K-LINCS DCIC because different LINCS data generation centers use different but overlapping assays, perturbations (genes/proteins, small-molecules), cell-lines, disease models, readouts and other common entities. Most major data repositories such as GEO or Chorus currently do not have advanced web-based forms to capture metadata about dataset instances from their data submitters. In year 1, the BD2K-LINCS DCIC developed the LINCS Dataset Registry (LDR) system to capture, visualize and manage all LINCS released datasets. LDR is a modern, mobile-friendly web application designed to streamline the process of submitting, approving, and releasing datasets. LDR consists of a client-side application created with the JavaScript library AngularJS and a web server application written in NodeJS. The server's extensive API's communicate to a MongoDB database responsible for storing and querying each center's data. LDR has login authentication functionality that enables the security of unreleased datasets, and its advanced input forms allow for fast, hassle-free data entry. Form entities have autocomplete functionality drawing from ontologies and dictionaries managed by live remote servers. LDR also contains a dataset-specific message board that enables communication between the LINCS data generation centers and the NIH staff to facilitate an approval process.</p>
  <p>While designed for LINCS, LDR will be generalized to facilitate data capture for other projects. For a BD2K Common Fund supplement in collaboration with the MacCoss Lab at the University of Washington, we will reuse the LDR code as an additional feature for Chorus, a new cloud-based application that provides scientists with the ability to securely store, analyze and share their MS data regardless of the original raw file format. The goal of Chorus is to create a complete catalogue of the worldâ€™s mass spectrometric data that can be openly accessed by, and freely accessible to, the global scientific community as well as the general public. Hence, the web-forms, developed for LINCS, will be provided as a web-service and will be embedded within Chorus. This effort will serve as a model for the Chorus/proteomics community to better annotate their proteomics data submissions but will also introduce a global solution for other repositories.</p>
