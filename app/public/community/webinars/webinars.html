            The
            <a ui-sref="dcic">BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC)</a> is the
            data coordination center for the NIH Common Fund’s Library of Integrated
            Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program, which aims to characterize
            how a variety of types of cells, tissues and networks respond to disruption
            by drugs and other factors. The center supports data science research
            focusing on interpreting and integrating LINCS-generated data from different
            data types and databases in the LINCS-funded projects. This center is
            co-funded by
            <a href="http://bd2k.nih.gov/#sthash.UHtPu2rQ.dpbs">BD2K</a> and the
            <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/">NIH Common Fund</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The organizational structure of the Center includes a strong Consortium Coordination
            and Administration (CCA) that supports and manages the Center’s goals
            and deliverables, and coordinates activities across the LINCS and BD2K
            programs.

          <p>
            The
            <a ui-sref="phaseOne">LINCS Pilot Phase 1</a> was composed of 10 centers: two data production/analysis
            centers, that generated data for the LINCS matrix, four centers dedicated
            to developing technology to complement and facilitate the collection
            of cellular signatures, and four centers that developed computational
            tools for analyzing the data produced by the data production centers.
            In addition, two external supplements, as well as a number of internal
            collaborations, supported and augmented the work done by the LINCS centers.
