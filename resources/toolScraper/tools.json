One of its most prominent applications is the sequencing of whole genomes or targeted regions of the genome such as all exonic regions (i.e., the exome). Here, the objective is the identification of genetic variants such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The extraction of SNPs from the raw genetic sequences involves many processing steps and the application of a diverse set of tools. We review the essential building blocks for a pipeline that calls SNPs from raw HTS data. The pipeline includes quality control, mapping of short reads to the reference genome, visualization and post-processing of the alignment including base quality recalibration. The final steps of the pipeline include the SNP calling procedure along with filtering of SNP candidates. The steps of this pipeline are accompanied by an analysis of a publicly available whole-exome sequencing dataset. To this end, we employ several alignment programs and SNP calling routines for highlighting the fact that the choice of the tools significantly affects the final results.","title":"A beginners guide to SNP calling from high-throughput DNA-sequencing data","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22886560"},

Somatic (cancer-only) single nucleotide variants (SNVs) are the simplest class of mutation, yet their identification in DNA sequencing data is confounded by germline polymorphisms, tumour heterogeneity and sequencing and analysis errors. Four recently published algorithms for the detection of somatic SNV sites in matched cancer-normal sequencing datasets are VarScan, SomaticSniper, JointSNVMix and Strelka. In this analysis, we apply these four SNV calling algorithms to cancer-normal Illumina exome sequencing of a chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patient. The candidate SNV sites returned by each algorithm are filtered to remove likely false positives, then characterized and compared to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of each SNV calling algorithm.<br>RESULTS: Comparing the candidate SNV sets returned by VarScan, SomaticSniper, JointSNVMix2 and Strelka revealed substantial differences with respect to the number and character of sites returned; the somatic probability scores assigned to the same sites; their susceptibility to various sources of noise; and their sensitivities to low-allelic-fraction candidates.<br>AVAILABILITY: Data accession number SRA081939, code at http://code.google.com/p/snv-caller-review/<br>CONTACT: david.adelson@adelaide.edu.au<br>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","title":"A comparative analysis of algorithms for somatic SNV detection in cancer","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23842810"},
{"description":"Authors: Eren, K., Deveci, M., Kucuktunc, O., and Catalyurek, U.V.<br><br>Abstract: The need to analyze high-dimension biological data is driving the development of new data mining methods. Biclustering algorithms have been successfully applied to gene expression data to discover local patterns, in which a subset of genes exhibit similar expression levels over a subset of conditions. However, it is not clear which algorithms are best suited for this task. Many algorithms have been published in the past decade, most of which have been compared only to a small number of algorithms. Surveys and comparisons exist in the literature, but because of the large number and variety of biclustering algorithms, they are quickly outdated. In this article we partially address this problem of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of existing biclustering methods. We used the BiBench package to compare 12 algorithms, many of which were recently published or have not been extensively studied. The algorithms were tested on a suite of synthetic data sets to measure their performance on data with varying conditions, such as different bicluster models, varying noise, varying numbers of biclusters and overlapping biclusters. The algorithms were also tested on eight large gene expression data sets obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis was performed on the resulting biclusters, and the best enrichment terms are reported. Our analyses show that the biclustering method and its parameters should be selected based on the desired model, whether that model allows overlapping biclusters, and its robustness to noise. In addition, we observe that the biclustering algorithms capable of finding more than one model are more successful at capturing biologically relevant clusters.","title":"A comparative analysis of biclustering algorithms for gene expression data","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22772837"},

In particular, label-free shotgun proteomics is highly effective for the identification of peptides and subsequently obtaining a global protein profile of a sample. As a result, this approach is widely used for discovery studies. Typically, the objective of these discovery studies is to identify proteins that are affected by some condition of interest (e.g. disease, exposure). However, for complex biological samples, label-free LC-MS proteomics experiments measure peptides and do not directly yield protein quantities. Thus, protein quantification must be inferred from one or more measured peptides. In recent years, many computational approaches to relative protein quantification of label-free LC-MS data have been published. In this review, we examine the most commonly employed quantification approaches to relative protein abundance from peak intensity values, evaluate their individual merits, and discuss challenges in the use of the various computational approaches.","title":"A comparative analysis of computational approaches to relative protein quantification using peptide peak intensities in label-free LC-MS proteomics experiments","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23019139"},

In addition to varying their basic algorithmic approach to classification, some methods screen sequence reads for 'barcoding genes' like 16S rRNA, or various types of protein-coding genes.

Biologists train classification models on a few thousand visually classified example cells and iteratively improve the training data by visual inspection of the important misclassified phenotypes.

Many software packages have been developed for the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between treatment groups based on RNA-Seq data. However, there is a lack of consensus on how to approach an optimal study design and choice of suitable software for the analysis. In this comparative study we evaluate the performance of three of the most frequently used software tools: Cufflinks-Cuffdiff2, DESeq and edgeR. A number of important parameters of RNA-Seq technology were taken into consideration, including the number of replicates, sequencing depth, and balanced vs. unbalanced sequencing depth within and between groups. We benchmarked results relative to sets of DEGs identified through either quantitative RT-PCR or microarray. We observed that edgeR performs slightly better than DESeq and Cuffdiff2 in terms of the ability to uncover true positives. Overall, DESeq or taking the intersection of DEGs from two or more tools is recommended if the number of false positives is a major concern in the study. In other circumstances, edgeR is slightly preferable for differential expression analysis at the expense of potentially introducing more false positives.","title":"A comparative study of techniques for differential expression analysis on RNA-Seq data","url":"http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/05/28/005611"},

{"description":"Authors: Richards, A.L., Holmans, P., O'Donovan, M.C., Owen, M.J., and Jones, L.<br><br>Abstract: BACKGROUND: DNA microarrays, which determine the expression levels of tens of thousands of genes from a sample, are an important research tool. However, the volume of data they produce can be an obstacle to interpretation of the results. Clustering the genes on the basis of similarity of their expression profiles can simplify the data, and potentially provides an important source of biological inference, but these methods have not been tested systematically on datasets from complex human tissues. In this paper, four clustering methods, CRC, k-means, ISA and memISA, are used upon three brain expression datasets. The results are compared on speed, gene coverage and GO enrichment. The effects of combining the clusters produced by each method are also assessed.<br>RESULTS: k-means outperforms the other methods, with 100% gene coverage and GO enrichments only slightly exceeded by memISA and ISA. Those two methods produce greater GO enrichments on the datasets used, but at the cost of much lower gene coverage, fewer clusters produced, and speed. The clusters they find are largely different to those produced by k-means. Combining clusters produced by k-means and memISA or ISA leads to increased GO enrichment and number of clusters produced (compared to k-means alone), without negatively impacting gene coverage. memISA can also find potentially disease-related clusters. In two independent dorsolateral prefrontal cortex datasets, it finds three overlapping clusters that are either enriched for genes associated with schizophrenia, genes differentially expressed in schizophrenia, or both. Two of these clusters are enriched for genes of the MAP kinase pathway, suggesting a possible role for this pathway in the aetiology of schizophrenia.<br>CONCLUSION: Considered alone, k-means clustering is the most effective of the four methods on typical microarray brain expression datasets. However, memISA and ISA can add extra high-quality clusters to the set produced by k-means, so combining these three methods is the method of choice.","title":"A comparison of four clustering methods for brain expression microarray data","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19032745"},
{"description":"Authors: Hong, F., and Breitling, R.<br><br>Abstract: MOTIVATION: The proliferation of public data repositories creates a need for meta-analysis methods to efficiently evaluate, integrate and validate related datasets produced by independent groups. A t-based approach has been proposed to integrate effect size from multiple studies by modeling both intra- and between-study variation. Recently, a non-parametric 'rank product' method, which is derived based on biological reasoning of fold-change criteria, has been applied to directly combine multiple datasets into one meta study. Fisher's Inverse chi(2) method, which only depends on P-values from individual analyses of each dataset, has been used in a couple of medical studies. While these methods address the question from different angles, it is not clear how they compare with each other.<br>RESULTS: We comparatively evaluate the three methods; t-based hierarchical modeling, rank products and Fisher's Inverse chi(2) test with P-values from either the t-based or the rank product method. A simulation study shows that the rank product method, in general, has higher sensitivity and selectivity than the t-based method in both individual and meta-analysis, especially in the setting of small sample size and/or large between-study variation. Not surprisingly, Fisher's chi(2) method highly depends on the method used in the individual analysis. Application to real datasets demonstrates that meta-analysis achieves more reliable identification than an individual analysis, and rank products are more robust in gene ranking, which leads to a much higher reproducibility among independent studies.

{"description":"Authors: Soneson, C., and Delorenzi, M.<br><br>Abstract: BACKGROUND: Finding genes that are differentially expressed between conditions is an integral part of understanding the molecular basis of phenotypic variation. In the past decades, DNA microarrays have been used extensively to quantify the abundance of mRNA corresponding to different genes, and more recently high-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful competitor. As the cost of sequencing decreases, it is conceivable that the use of RNA-seq for differential expression analysis will increase rapidly. To exploit the possibilities and address the challenges posed by this relatively new type of data, a number of software packages have been developed especially for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data.<br>RESULTS: We conducted an extensive comparison of eleven methods for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data. All methods are freely available within the R framework and take as input a matrix of counts, i.e. the number of reads mapping to each genomic feature of interest in each of a number of samples. We evaluate the methods based on both simulated data and real RNA-seq data.<br>CONCLUSIONS: Very small sample sizes, which are still common in RNA-seq experiments, impose problems for all evaluated methods and any results obtained under such conditions should be interpreted with caution. For larger sample sizes, the methods combining a variance-stabilizing transformation with the 'limma' method for differential expression analysis perform well under many different conditions, as does the nonparametric SAMseq method.","title":"A comparison of methods for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23497356"},

In this study we directly compared a number of multivariate GWAS methods using simulated data. We focused on six methods that are implemented in the software packages PLINK, SNPTEST, MultiPhen, BIMBAM, PCHAT and TATES, and also compared them to standard univariate GWAS, analysis of the first principal component of the traits, and meta-analysis of univariate results. We simulated data (N = 1000) for three quantitative traits and one bi-allelic quantitative trait locus (QTL), and varied the number of traits associated with the QTL (explained variance 0.1%), minor allele frequency of the QTL, residual correlation between the traits, and the sign of the correlation induced by the QTL relative to the residual correlation. We compared the power of the methods using empirically fixed significance thresholds (alpha = 0.05). Our results showed that the multivariate methods implemented in PLINK, SNPTEST, MultiPhen and BIMBAM performed best for the majority of the tested scenarios, with a notable increase in power for scenarios with an opposite sign of genetic and residual correlation. All multivariate analyses resulted in a higher power than univariate analyses, even when only one of the traits was associated with the QTL. Hence, use of multivariate GWAS methods can be recommended, even when genetic correlations between traits are weak.","title":"A comparison of multivariate genome-wide association methods","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763738"},

Normalization is a process for reducing this variation. It is common to see non-linear relations between arrays and the standard normalization provided by Affymetrix does not perform well in these situations.<br>RESULTS: We present three methods of performing normalization at the probe intensity level. These methods are called complete data methods because they make use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly available datasets are used to carry out the comparisons. The simplest and quickest complete data method is found to perform favorably.<br>AVAILABILITY: Software implementing all three of the complete data normalization methods is available as part of the R package Affy, which is a part of the Bioconductor project http://www.bioconductor.org.<br>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Additional figures may be found at http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bolstad/normalize/index.html","title":"A comparison of normalization methods for high density oligonucleotide array data based on variance and bias","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12538238"},

Different methods, including cyclic loess, quantile normalization and median or mean normalization, have been utilized to normalize microarray data. Although there is considerable literature regarding normalization techniques for mRNA microarray data, there are no publications comparing normalization techniques for microRNA (miRNA) microarray data, which are subject to similar sources of measurement error. In this paper, we compare the performance of cyclic loess, quantile normalization, median normalization and no normalization for a single-color microRNA microarray dataset. We show that the quantile normalization method works best in reducing differences in miRNA expression values for replicate tissue samples. By showing that the total mean squared error are lowest across almost all 36 investigated tissue samples, we are assured that the bias correction provided by quantile normalization is not outweighed by additional error variance that can arise from a more complex normalization method. Furthermore, we show that quantile normalization does not achieve these results by compression of scale.","title":"A comparison of normalization techniques for microRNA microarray data","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18673291"},

This algorithm plays a vital role in determining the docking accuracy. To evaluate the relative performance of different optimization algorithms and provide guidance for real applications, we performed a comparative study on six efficient optimization algorithms, containing two evolutionary algorithm (EA)-based optimizers (LGA, DockDE) and four particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based optimizers (SODock, varCPSO, varCPSO-ls, FIPSDock), which were implemented into the protein-ligand docking program AutoDock. We unified the objective functions by applying the same scoring function, and built a new fitness accuracy as the evaluation criterion that incorporates optimization accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. The varCPSO and varCPSO-ls algorithms show high efficiency with fast convergence speed. However, their accuracy is not optimal, as they cannot reach very low energies. SODock has the highest accuracy and robustness. In addition, SODock shows good performance in efficiency when optimizing drug-like ligands with less than ten rotatable bonds. FIPSDock shows excellent robustness and is close to SODock in accuracy and efficiency. In general, the four PSO-based algorithms show superior performance than the two EA-based algorithms, especially for highly flexible ligands. Our method can be regarded as a reference for the validation of new optimization algorithms in protein-ligand docking.","title":"A comparison of various optimization algorithms of protein-ligand docking programs by fitness accuracy","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24935106"},

{"description":"Authors: Thompson, J.D., Linard, B., Lecompte, O., and Poch, O.<br><br>Abstract: Multiple comparison or alignmentof protein sequences has become a fundamental tool in many different domains in modern molecular biology, from evolutionary studies to prediction of 2D/3D structure, molecular function and inter-molecular interactions etc. By placing the sequence in the framework of the overall family, multiple alignments can be used to identify conserved features and to highlight differences or specificities. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive evaluation of many of the most popular methods for multiple sequence alignment (MSA), based on a new benchmark test set. The benchmark is designed to represent typical problems encountered when aligning the large protein sequence sets that result from today's high throughput biotechnologies. We show that alignmentmethods have significantly progressed and can now identify most of the shared sequence features that determine the broad molecular function(s) of a protein family, even for divergent sequences. However,we have identified a number of important challenges. First, the locally conserved regions, that reflect functional specificities or that modulate a protein's function in a given cellular context,are less well aligned. Second, motifs in natively disordered regions are often misaligned. Third, the badly predicted or fragmentary protein sequences, which make up a large proportion of today's databases, lead to a significant number of alignment errors. Based on this study, we demonstrate that the existing MSA methods can be exploited in combination to improve alignment accuracy, although novel approaches will still be needed to fully explore the most difficult regions. We then propose knowledge-enabled, dynamic solutions that will hopefully pave the way to enhanced alignment construction and exploitation in future evolutionary systems biology studies.","title":"A comprehensive benchmark study of multiple sequence alignment methods: current challenges and future perspectives","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21483869"},

We summarize these predictors from several significant perspectives including their design, outputs and availability. We perform empirical assessment of methods that offer web servers using a new benchmark data set characterized by a more complete annotation that includes binding residues transferred from the same or similar proteins. We show that predictors of DNA-binding (RNA-binding) residues offer relatively strong predictive performance but they are unable to properly separate DNA- from RNA-binding residues. We design and empirically assess several types of consensuses and demonstrate that machine learning (ML)-based approaches provide improved predictive performance when compared with the individual predictors of DNA-binding residues or RNA-binding residues. We also formulate and execute first-of-its-kind study that targets combined prediction of DNA- and RNA-binding residues. We design and test three types of consensuses for this prediction and conclude that this novel approach that relies on ML design provides better predictive quality than individual predictors when tested on prediction of DNA- and RNA-binding residues individually. It also substantially improves discrimination between these two types of nucleic acids. Our results suggest that development of a new generation of predictors would benefit from using training data sets that combine both RNA- and DNA-binding proteins, designing new inputs that specifically target either DNA- or RNA-binding residues and pursuing combined prediction of DNA- and RNA-binding residues.","title":"A comprehensive comparative review of sequence-based predictors of DNA- and RNA-binding residues","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25935161"},
{"description":"Authors: Lindner, R., and Friedel, C.C.<br><br>Abstract: Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) overcomes limitations of previously used RNA quantification methods and provides one experimental framework for both high-throughput characterization and quantification of transcripts at the nucleotide level. The first step and a major challenge in the analysis of such experiments is the mapping of sequencing reads to a transcriptomic origin including the identification of splicing events. In recent years, a large number of such mapping algorithms have been developed, all of which have in common that they require algorithms for aligning a vast number of reads to genomic or transcriptomic sequences. Although the FM-index based aligner Bowtie has become a de facto standard within mapping pipelines, a much larger number of possible alignment algorithms have been developed also including other variants of FM-index based aligners. Accordingly, developers and users of RNA-seq mapping pipelines have the choice among a large number of available alignment algorithms. To provide guidance in the choice of alignment algorithms for these purposes, we evaluated the performance of 14 widely used alignment programs from three different algorithmic classes: algorithms using either hashing of the reference transcriptome, hashing of reads, or a compressed FM-index representation of the genome. Here, special emphasis was placed on both precision and recall and the performance for different read lengths and numbers of mismatches and indels in a read. Our results clearly showed the significant reduction in memory footprint and runtime provided by FM-index based aligners at a precision and recall comparable to the best hash table based aligners. Furthermore, the recently developed Bowtie 2 alignment algorithm shows a remarkable tolerance to both sequencing errors and indels, thus, essentially making hash-based aligners obsolete.","title":"A comprehensive evaluation of alignment algorithms in the context of RNA-seq","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23300661"},
{"description":"Authors: Hunt, M., Newbold, C., Berriman, M., and Otto, T.D.<br><br>Abstract: BACKGROUND: Genome assembly is typically a two-stage process: contig assembly followed by the use of paired sequencing reads to join contigs into scaffolds. Scaffolds are usually the focus of reported assembly statistics; longer scaffolds greatly facilitate the use of genome sequences in downstream analyses, and it is appealing to present larger numbers as metrics of assembly performance. However, scaffolds are highly prone to errors, especially when generated using short reads, which can directly result in inflated assembly statistics. RESULTS: Here we provide the first independent evaluation of scaffolding tools for second-generation sequencing data. We find large variations in the quality of results depending on the tool and dataset used. Even extremely simple test cases of perfect input, constructed to elucidate the behaviour of each algorithm, produced some surprising results. We further dissect the performance of the scaffolders using real and simulated sequencing data derived from the genomes of Staphylococcus aureus, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Plasmodium falciparum and Homo sapiens. The results from simulated data are of high quality, with several of the tools producing perfect output. However, at least 10% of joins remains unidentified when using real data. CONCLUSIONS: The scaffolders vary in their usability, speed and number of correct and missed joins made between contigs. Results from real data highlight opportunities for further improvements of the tools. Overall, SGA, SOPRA and SSPACE generally outperform the other tools on our datasets.

Although there exist quite a few studies in this regard, no previous effort has been made to review these works in a comprehensive manner. Here we review the computational approaches that are devoted to the analysis and prediction of HIV-1-human PPIs. We have broadly categorized these studies into two fields: computational analysis of HIV-1-human PPI network and prediction of novel PPIs. We have also presented a comparative assessment of these studies and proposed some methodologies for discussing the implication of their results. We have also reviewed different computational techniques for predicting HIV-1-human PPIs and provided a comparative study of their applicability. We believe that our effort will provide helpful insights to the HIV research community.","title":"A review of in silico approaches for analysis and prediction of HIV-1-human protein-protein interactions","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25479794"},
{"description":"Authors: Habibi, N., Mohd Hashim, S.Z., Norouzi, A., and Samian, M.R.<br><br>Abstract: BACKGROUND: Over the last 20 years in biotechnology, the production of recombinant proteins has been a crucial bioprocess in both biopharmaceutical and research arena in terms of human health, scientific impact and economic volume. Although logical strategies of genetic engineering have been established, protein overexpression is still an art. In particular, heterologous expression is often hindered by low level of production and frequent fail due to opaque reasons. The problem is accentuated because there is no generic solution available to enhance heterologous overexpression. For a given protein, the extent of its solubility can indicate the quality of its function. Over 30% of synthesized proteins are not soluble. In certain experimental circumstances, including temperature, expression host, etc., protein solubility is a feature eventually defined by its sequence. Until now, numerous methods based on machine learning are proposed to predict the solubility of protein merely from its amino acid sequence. In spite of the 20 years of research on the matter, no comprehensive review is available on the published methods.<br>RESULTS: This paper presents an extensive review of the existing models to predict protein solubility in Escherichia coli recombinant protein overexpression system. The models are investigated and compared regarding the datasets used, features, feature selection methods, machine learning techniques and accuracy of prediction. A discussion on the models is provided at the end.<br>CONCLUSIONS: This study aims to investigate extensively the machine learning based methods to predict recombinant protein solubility, so as to offer a general as well as a detailed understanding for researches in the field. Some of the models present acceptable prediction performances and convenient user interfaces. These models can be considered as valuable tools to predict recombinant protein overexpression results before performing real laboratory experiments, thus saving labour, time and cost.","title":"A review of machine learning methods to predict the solubility of overexpressed recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885721"},
{"description":"Authors: Hou, L., and Zhao, H.<br><br>Abstract: In the recent decade, high-throughput genotyping and next-generation sequencing platforms have enabled genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of many complex human diseases. These studies have discovered many disease susceptible loci, and unveiled unexpected disease mechanisms. Despite these successes, these identified variants only explain a small proportion of the genetic contributions to these diseases and many more remain to be found. This is largely due to the small effect sizes of most disease-associated variants and limited sample size. As a result, it is critical to leverage other information to more effectively prioritize GWAS signals to increase replication rates and better understand disease mechanisms. In this review, we introduce the biological/genomic features that have been found to be informative for post-GWAS prioritization, and discuss available tools to utilize these features for prioritization.","title":"A review of post-GWAS prioritization approaches","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24367376"},

The explosive growth of large-scale genomic and phenotypic data, as well as data of small molecular compounds with granted regulatory approval, is enabling new developments for computational repositioning. To achieve the shortest path toward new drug indications, advanced data processing and analysis strategies are critical for making sense of these heterogeneous molecular measurements.

{"description":"Authors: Das, M.K., and Dai, H.K.<br><br>Abstract: BACKGROUND: Unraveling the mechanisms that regulate gene expression is a major challenge in biology. An important task in this challenge is to identify regulatory elements, especially the binding sites in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for transcription factors. These binding sites are short DNA segments that are called motifs. Recent advances in genome sequence availability and in high-throughput gene expression analysis technologies have allowed for the development of computational methods for motif finding. As a result, a large number of motif finding algorithms have been implemented and applied to various motif models over the past decade. This survey reviews the latest developments in DNA motif finding algorithms.<br>RESULTS: Earlier algorithms use promoter sequences of coregulated genes from single genome and search for statistically overrepresented motifs. Recent algorithms are designed to use phylogenetic footprinting or orthologous sequences and also an integrated approach where promoter sequences of coregulated genes and phylogenetic footprinting are used. All the algorithms studied have been reported to correctly detect the motifs that have been previously detected by laboratory experimental approaches, and some algorithms were able to find novel motifs. However, most of these motif finding algorithms have been shown to work successfully in yeast and other lower organisms, but perform significantly worse in higher organisms.<br>CONCLUSION: Despite considerable efforts to date, DNA motif finding remains a complex challenge for biologists and computer scientists. Researchers have taken many different approaches in developing motif discovery tools and the progress made in this area of research is very encouraging. Performance comparison of different motif finding tools and identification of the best tools have proven to be a difficult task because tools are designed based on algorithms and motif models that are diverse and complex and our incomplete understanding of the biology of regulatory mechanism does not always provide adequate evaluation of underlying algorithms over motif models.","title":"A survey of DNA motif finding algorithms","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18047721"},

This technique has multiple applications in different fields (medical diagnosis, forensic science, parentage testing, food industry, agriculture and many others). An important task in molecular epidemiology of infectious diseases is the analysis and comparison of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. This is applied to determine the clonal diversity of bacteria in the follow-up of outbreaks or for tracking specific clones of special relevance. The resulting images produced by DNA fingerprinting are sometimes difficult to interpret, and multiple tools have been developed to simplify this task. In this article, we present a survey of tools for analysing DNA fingerprints. In particular, we compare 33 tools using a set of predefined criteria. The comparison was carried out by hands-on experiences-whenever possible-and inspecting the documentation of the tools. As no system is preferred in all the possible scenarios, we have created a spreadsheet that can be customized by researchers to determine the best system for their needs.","title":"A survey of tools for analysing DNA fingerprints","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25825453"},

Specifically, whole-exome sequencing using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies is gaining popularity in the human genetics community due to the moderate costs, manageable data amounts and straightforward interpretation of analysis results. While whole-exome and, in the near future, whole-genome sequencing are becoming commodities, data analysis still poses significant challenges and led to the development of a plethora of tools supporting specific parts of the analysis workflow or providing a complete solution. Here, we surveyed 205 tools for whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing data analysis supporting five distinct analytical steps: quality assessment, alignment, variant identification, variant annotation and visualization. We report an overview of the functionality, features and specific requirements of the individual tools. We then selected 32 programs for variant identification, variant annotation and visualization, which were subjected to hands-on evaluation using four data sets: one set of exome data from two patients with a rare disease for testing identification of germline mutations, two cancer data sets for testing variant callers for somatic mutations, copy number variations and structural variations, and one semi-synthetic data set for testing identification of copy number variations. Our comprehensive survey and evaluation of NGS tools provides a valuable guideline for human geneticists working on Mendelian disorders, complex diseases and cancers.

The underlying concept, which is often referred to as biclustering, allows to identify sets of genes sharing compatible expression patterns across subsets of samples, and its usefulness has been demonstrated for different organisms and datasets. Several biclustering methods have been proposed in the literature; however, it is not clear how the different techniques compare with each other with respect to the biological relevance of the clusters as well as with other characteristics such as robustness and sensitivity to noise. Accordingly, no guidelines concerning the choice of the biclustering method are currently available.<br>RESULTS: First, this paper provides a methodology for comparing and validating biclustering methods that includes a simple binary reference model. Although this model captures the essential features of most biclustering approaches, it is still simple enough to exactly determine all optimal groupings; to this end, we propose a fast divide-and-conquer algorithm (Bimax). Second, we evaluate the performance of five salient biclustering algorithms together with the reference model and a hierarchical clustering method on various synthetic and real datasets for Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis thaliana. The comparison reveals that (1) biclustering in general has advantages over a conventional hierarchical clustering approach, (2) there are considerable performance differences between the tested methods and (3) already the simple reference model delivers relevant patterns within all considered settings.","title":"A systematic comparison and evaluation of biclustering methods for gene expression data","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16500941"},

However, metagenomics still represents a field in development, and standardized tools and approaches to handle and compare metagenomes have not been established yet. An important reason accounting for the latter is the continuous changes in the type of sequencing data available, for example, long versus short sequencing reads. Here, we provide a guide to bioinformatic pipelines developed to accomplish the following tasks, focusing primarily on those developed by our team: (i) assemble a metagenomic dataset; (ii) determine the level of sequence coverage obtained and the amount of sequencing required to obtain complete coverage; (iii) identify the taxonomic affiliation of a metagenomic read or assembled contig; and (iv) determine differentially abundant genes, pathways, and species between different datasets. Most of these pipelines do not depend on the type of sequences available or can be easily adjusted to fit different types of sequences, and are freely available (for instance, through our lab Web site: http://www.enve-omics.gatech.edu/). The limitations of current approaches, as well as the computational aspects that can be further improved, will also be briefly discussed.

{"description":"Authors: Stead, L.F., Sutton, K.M., Taylor, G.R., Quirke, P., and Rabbitts, P.<br><br>Abstract: Current methods for resolving genetically distinct subclones in tumor samples require somatic mutations to be clustered by allelic frequencies, which are determined by applying a variant calling program to next-generation sequencing data. Such programs were developed to accurately distinguish true polymorphisms and somatic mutations from the artifactual nonreference alleles introduced during library preparation and sequencing. However, numerous variant callers exist with no clear indication of the best performer for subclonal analysis, in which the accuracy of the assigned variant frequency is as important as correctly indicating whether the variant is present or not. Furthermore, sequencing depth (the number of times that a genomic position is sequenced) affects the ability to detect low-allelic fraction variants and accurately assign their allele frequencies. We created two synthetic sequencing datasets, and sequenced real KRAS amplicons, with variants spiked in at specific ratios, to assess which caller performs best in terms of both variant detection and assignment of allelic frequencies. We also assessed the sequencing depths required to detect low-allelic fraction variants. We found that VarScan2 performed best overall with sequencing depths of 100x, 250x, 500x, and 1,000x required to accurately identify variants present at 10%, 5%, 2.5%, and 1%, respectively.","title":"Accurately identifying low-allelic fraction variants in single samples with next-generation sequencing: applications in tumor subclone resolution","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23766071"},

However, the use of network-based pathways to interpret 'omics' data has been limited owing to the fact that their computation has, until very recently, been infeasible in large (genome-scale) metabolic networks. In this review article, we describe the progress made in the past few years in the field of network-based metabolic pathway analysis. In particular, we review in detail novel optimization techniques to compute elementary flux modes, an important pathway concept in this field. In addition, we summarize approaches for the integration of metabolic pathways with gene expression data, discussing recent advances using network-based pathway concepts.","title":"Advances in network-based metabolic pathway analysis and gene expression data integration","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626528"},

{"description":"Authors: Zimmermann, K., Jentsch, M., Rasche, A., Hummel, M., and Leser, U.<br><br>Abstract: BACKGROUND: The analysis of differential splicing (DS) is crucial for understanding physiological processes in cells and organs. In particular, aberrant transcripts are known to be involved in various diseases including cancer. A widely used technique for studying DS are exon arrays. Over the last decade a variety of algorithms for the detection of DS events from exon arrays has been developed. However, no comprehensive, comparative evaluation including sensitivity to the most important data features has been conducted so far. To this end, we created multiple data sets based on simulated data to assess strengths and weaknesses of seven published methods as well as a newly developed method, KLAS. Additionally, we evaluated all methods on two cancer data sets that comprised RT-PCR validated results.<br>RESULTS: Our studies indicated ARH as the most robust methods when integrating the results over all scenarios and data sets. Nevertheless, special cases or requirements favor other methods. While FIRMA was highly sensitive according to experimental data, SplicingCompass, MIDAS and ANOSVA showed high specificity throughout the scenarios. On experimental data ARH, FIRMA, MIDAS, and KLAS performed best.<br>CONCLUSIONS: Each method shows different characteristics regarding sensitivity, specificity, interference to certain data settings and robustness over multiple data sets. While some methods can be considered as generally good choices over all data sets and scenarios, other methods show heterogeneous prediction quality on the different data sets. The adequate method has to be chosen carefully and with a defined study aim in mind.","title":"Algorithms for differential splicing detection using exon arrays: a comparative assessment","url":"http://doi.org/doi:10.1186/s12864-015-1322-x"},

RNAseq is a powerful technique to profile both long and short RNA expression, and the depth of information gained from distinct RNAseq methods is striking and facilitates discovery. In addition to expression analysis, distinct RNAseq approaches also allow investigators the ability to assess transcriptional elongation, DNA variance and exogenous RNA content. Here we review the current state of the art in transcriptome sequencing and address epigenetic regulation, quantification of transcription activation, RNAseq output and a diverse set of applications for RNAseq data. We detail how RNAseq can be used to identify allele-specific expression, single-nucleotide polymorphisms and somatic mutations and discuss the benefits and limitations of using RNAseq to monitor DNA characteristics. Moreover, we highlight the power of combining RNA- and DNAseq methods for genomic analysis. In summary, RNAseq provides the opportunity to gain greater insight into transcriptional regulation and output than simply miRNA and mRNA profiling.","title":"Alternative applications for distinct RNA sequencing strategies","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25246237"},

SRM has emerged as an important technique for targeted and hypothesis-driven proteomic research, and is becoming the reference method for protein quantification in complex biological samples. SRM offers high selectivity, a lower limit of detection and improved reproducibility, compared to conventional shot-gun-based tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) methods. Unlike LC-MS/MS, which requires computationally intensive informatic postanalysis, SRM requires preacquisition bioinformatic analysis to determine proteotypic peptides and optimal transitions to uniquely identify and to accurately quantitate proteins of interest. Extensive arrays of bioinformatics software tools, both web-based and stand-alone, have been published to assist researchers to determine optimal peptides and transition sets. The transitions are oftentimes selected based on preferred precursor charge state, peptide molecular weight, hydrophobicity, fragmentation pattern at a given collision energy (CE), and instrumentation chosen. Validation of the selected transitions for each peptide is critical since peptide performance varies depending on the mass spectrometer used. In this review, we provide an overview of open source and commercial bioinformatic tools for analyzing LC-MS data acquired by SRM.","title":"An assessment of current bioinformatic solutions for analyzing LC-MS data acquired by selected reaction monitoring technology","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22577019"},
{"description":"Authors: Qin, L.X., Tuschl, T., and Singer, S.<br><br>Abstract: BACKGROUND: Methods for array normalization, such as median and quantile normalization, were developed for mRNA expression arrays. These methods assume few or symmetric differential expression of genes on the array. However, these assumptions are not necessarily appropriate for microRNA expression arrays because they consist of only a few hundred genes and a reasonable fraction of them are anticipated to have disease relevance.<br>METHODS: We collected microRNA expression profiles for human tissue samples from a liposarcoma study using the Agilent microRNA arrays. For a subset of the samples, we also profiled their microRNA expression using deep sequencing. We empirically evaluated methods for normalization of microRNA arrays using deep sequencing data derived from the same tissue samples as the benchmark.<br>RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrated array effects in microRNA arrays using data from a liposarcoma study. We found moderately high correlation between Agilent data and sequence data on the same tumors, with the Pearson correlation coefficients ranging from 0.6 to 0.9. Array normalization resulted in some improvement in the accuracy of the differential expression analysis. However, even with normalization, there is still a significant number of false positive and false negative microRNAs, many of which are expressed at moderate to high levels.<br>CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the need to develop more efficient normalization methods for microRNA arrays to further improve the detection of genes with disease relevance. Until better methods are developed, an existing normalization method such as quantile normalization should be applied when analyzing microRNA array data.","title":"An Empirical Evaluation of Normalization Methods for MicroRNA Arrays in a Liposarcoma Study","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23589668"},

The Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip is widely used to quantify DNA methylation; nevertheless, the design of an appropriate analysis pipeline faces severe challenges due to the convolution of biological and technical variability and the presence of a signal bias between Infinium I and II probe design types. Despite recent attempts to investigate how to analyze DNA methylation data with such an array design, it has not been possible to perform a comprehensive comparison between different bioinformatics pipelines due to the lack of appropriate data sets having both large sample size and sufficient number of technical replicates. Here we perform such a comparative analysis, targeting the problems of reducing the technical variability, eliminating the probe design bias and reducing the batch effect by exploiting two unpublished data sets, which included technical replicates and were profiled for DNA methylation either on peripheral blood, monocytes or muscle biopsies. We evaluated the performance of different analysis pipelines and demonstrated that: (1) it is critical to correct for the probe design type, since the amplitude of the measured methylation change depends on the underlying chemistry; (2) the effect of different normalization schemes is mixed, and the most effective method in our hands were quantile normalization and Beta Mixture Quantile dilation (BMIQ); (3) it is beneficial to correct for batch effects. In conclusion, our comparative analysis using a comprehensive data set suggests an efficient pipeline for proper identification of differentially methylated CpGs using the Illumina 450K arrays.","title":"An evaluation of analysis pipelines for DNA methylation profiling using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip platform","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23422812"},

Next-generation sequencing technology, including whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES), has become a primary strategy for studying the genetic basis of human disease. Several CNV calling tools have recently been developed on the basis of WES data. However, the comparative performance of these tools using real data remains unclear. An objective evaluation study of these tools in practical research situations would be beneficial. Here, we evaluated four well-known WES-based CNV detection tools (XHMM, CoNIFER, ExomeDepth, and CONTRA) using real data generated in house. After evaluation using six metrics, we found that the sensitive and accurate detection of CNVs in WES data remains challenging despite the many algorithms available. Each algorithm has its own strengths and weaknesses. None of the exome-based CNV calling methods performed well in all situations; in particular, compared with CNVs identified from high coverage WGS data from the same samples, all tools suffered from limited power. Our evaluation provides a comprehensive and objective comparison of several well-known detection tools designed for WES data, which will assist researchers in choosing the most suitable tools for their research needs.","title":"An evaluation of copy number variation detection tools from whole-exome sequencing data","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24599517"},

Our results clearly show that the most widely used tools are not necessarily the most accurate, that the most accurate tool is not necessarily the most time consuming, and that there is a high degree of variability between available tools. These findings are important as the conclusions of any metagenomics study are affected by errors in the predicted community composition.

{"description":"Authors: Adriaens, M.E., Jaillard, M., Eijssen, L.M., Mayer, C.D., and Evelo, C.T.<br><br>Abstract: BACKGROUND: The combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation with two-channel microarray technology enables genome-wide mapping of binding sites of DNA-interacting proteins (ChIP-on-chip) or sites with methylated CpG di-nucleotides (DNA methylation microarray). These powerful tools are the gateway to understanding gene transcription regulation. Since the goals of such studies, the sample preparation procedures, the microarray content and study design are all different from transcriptomics microarrays, the data pre-processing strategies traditionally applied to transcriptomics microarrays may not be appropriate. Particularly, the main challenge of the normalization of \"regulation microarrays\" is (i) to make the data of individual microarrays quantitatively comparable and (ii) to keep the signals of the enriched probes, representing DNA sequences from the precipitate, as distinguishable as possible from the signals of the un-enriched probes, representing DNA sequences largely absent from the precipitate.<br>RESULTS: We compare several widely used normalization approaches (VSN, LOWESS, quantile, T-quantile, Tukey's biweight scaling, Peng's method) applied to a selection of regulation microarray datasets, ranging from DNA methylation to transcription factor binding and histone modification studies. Through comparison of the data distributions of control probes and gene promoter probes before and after normalization, and assessment of the power to identify known enriched genomic regions after normalization, we demonstrate that there are clear differences in performance between normalization procedures.<br>CONCLUSION: T-quantile normalization applied separately on the channels and Tukey's biweight scaling outperform other methods in terms of the conservation of enriched and un-enriched signal separation, as well as in identification of genomic regions known to be enriched. T-quantile normalization is preferable as it additionally improves comparability between microarrays. In contrast, popular normalization approaches like quantile, LOWESS, Peng's method and VSN normalization alter the data distributions of regulation microarrays to such an extent that using these approaches will impact the reliability of the downstream analysis substantially.","title":"An evaluation of two-channel ChIP-on-chip and DNA methylation microarray normalization strategies","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22276688"},

Due to their widespread use, it is now time to perform a systematic analysis of the various algorithms currently in use. Using blood specimens used in the HUPO Plasma Proteome Project, we have evaluated five search algorithms with respect to their sensitivity and specificity, and have also accurately benchmarked them based on specified false-positive (FP) rates. Spectrum Mill and SEQUEST performed well in terms of sensitivity, but were inferior to MASCOT, X!Tandem, and Sonar in terms of specificity. Overall, MASCOT, a probabilistic search algorithm, correctly identified most peptides based on a specified FP rate. The rescoring algorithm, PeptideProphet, enhanced the overall performance of the SEQUEST algorithm, as well as provided predictable FP error rates. Ideally, score thresholds should be calculated for each peptide spectrum or minimally, derived from a reversed-sequence search as demonstrated in this study based on a validated data set. The availability of open-source search algorithms, such as X!Tandem, makes it feasible to further improve the validation process (manual or automatic) on the basis of \"consensus scoring\", i.e., the use of multiple (at least two) search algorithms to reduce the number of FPs. complement.","title":"An evaluation, comparison, and accurate benchmarking of several publicly available MS/MS search algorithms: sensitivity and specificity analysis","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16047398"},

HOMSTRAD, a collection of alignments of homologous proteins, is regularly used as a benchmark for sequence alignment though it is not designed as such, and lacks annotation of reliable regions within the alignment. We introduce this annotation into HOMSTRAD using protein structural superposition. Results on each database show that method performance is dependent on the input sequences. Alignment benchmarks are regularly used in combination to measure performance across a spectrum of alignment problems. Through combining benchmarks, it is possible to detect whether a program has been over-optimised for a single dataset, or alignment problem type.","title":"Analysis and comparison of benchmarks for multiple sequence alignment","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16922695"},

New sequencing technologies, such as deep sequencing, allow massive throughput of sequence data and greatly contribute to the field of disease causing mutation detection, in general, and indel detection, specifically. In order to infer indel presence (indel calling), the deep-sequencing data have to undergo comprehensive computational analysis. Selecting which indel calling software to use can often skew the results and inherent tool limitations may affect downstream analysis. In order to better understand these inter-software differences, we evaluated the performance of several indel calling software for short indel (1-10 nt) detection. We compared the software's sensitivity and predictive values in the presence of varying parameters such as read depth (coverage), read length, indel size and frequency. We pinpoint several key features that assist successful experimental design and appropriate tool selection.

These methods are based on widely different methodological assumptions. Some approaches test differential expression of each gene set against differential expression of the rest of the genes, whereas others test each gene set on its own. Also, some methods are based on a model in which the genes are the sampling units, whereas others treat the subjects as the sampling units. This article aims to clarify the assumptions behind different approaches and to indicate a preferential methodology of gene set testing.<br>RESULTS: We identify some crucial assumptions which are needed by the majority of methods. P-values derived from methods that use a model which takes the genes as the sampling unit are easily misinterpreted, as they are based on a statistical model that does not resemble the biological experiment actually performed. Furthermore, because these models are based on a crucial and unrealistic independence assumption between genes, the P-values derived from such methods can be wildly anti-conservative, as a simulation experiment shows. We also argue that methods that competitively test each gene set against the rest of the genes create an unnecessary rift between single gene testing and gene set testing.","title":"Analyzing gene expression data in terms of gene sets: methodological issues","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17303618"},

{"description":"Authors: Ponomarenko, J.V., and Bourne, P.E.<br><br>Abstract: BACKGROUND: The ability to predict antibody binding sites (aka antigenic determinants or B-cell epitopes) for a given protein is a precursor to new vaccine design and diagnostics. Among the various methods of B-cell epitope identification X-ray crystallography is one of the most reliable methods. Using these experimental data computational methods exist for B-cell epitope prediction. As the number of structures of antibody-protein complexes grows, further interest in prediction methods using 3D structure is anticipated. This work aims to establish a benchmark for 3D structure-based epitope prediction methods.<br>RESULTS: Two B-cell epitope benchmark datasets inferred from the 3D structures of antibody-protein complexes were defined. The first is a dataset of 62 representative 3D structures of protein antigens with inferred structural epitopes. The second is a dataset of 82 structures of antibody-protein complexes containing different structural epitopes. Using these datasets, eight web-servers developed for antibody and protein binding sites prediction have been evaluated. In no method did performance exceed a 40% precision and 46% recall. The values of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the evaluated methods were about 0.6 for ConSurf, DiscoTope, and PPI-PRED methods and above 0.65 but not exceeding 0.70 for protein-protein docking methods when the best of the top ten models for the bound docking were considered; the remaining methods performed close to random. The benchmark datasets are included as a supplement to this paper.<br>CONCLUSION: It may be possible to improve epitope prediction methods through training on datasets which include only immune epitopes and through utilizing more features characterizing epitopes, for example, the evolutionary conservation score. Notwithstanding, overall poor performance may reflect the generality of antigenicity and hence the inability to decipher B-cell epitopes as an intrinsic feature of the protein. It is an open question as to whether ultimately discriminatory features can be found.","title":"Antibody-protein interactions: benchmark datasets and prediction tools evaluation","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17910770"},

However, assembly of such data into high-quality, finished genome sequences remains challenging. Many genome assembly tools are available, but they differ greatly in terms of their performance (speed, scalability, hardware requirements, acceptance of newer read technologies) and in their final output (composition of assembled sequence). More importantly, it remains largely unclear how to best assess the quality of assembled genome sequences. The Assemblathon competitions are intended to assess current state-of-the-art methods in genome assembly.<br>RESULTS: In Assemblathon 2, we provided a variety of sequence data to be assembled for three vertebrate species (a bird, a fish, and snake). This resulted in a total of 43 submitted assemblies from 21 participating teams. We evaluated these assemblies using a combination of optical map data, Fosmid sequences, and several statistical methods. From over 100 different metrics, we chose ten key measures by which to assess the overall quality of the assemblies.<br>CONCLUSIONS: Many current genome assemblers produced useful assemblies, containing a significant representation of their genes and overall genome structure. However, the high degree of variability between the entries suggests that there is still much room for improvement in the field of genome assembly and that approaches which work well in assembling the genome of one species may not necessarily work well for another.","title":"Assemblathon 2: evaluating de novo methods of genome assembly in three vertebrate species","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23870653"},

{"description":"Authors: Schloss, P.D., and Westcott, S.L. (2011).<br><br>Abstract: In spite of technical advances that have provided increases in orders of magnitude in sequencing coverage, microbial ecologists still grapple with how to interpret the genetic diversity represented by the 16S rRNA gene. Two widely used approaches put sequences into bins based on either their similarity to reference sequences (i.e., phylotyping) or their similarity to other sequences in the community (i.e., operational taxonomic units [OTUs]). In the present study, we investigate three issues related to the interpretation and implementation of OTU-based methods. First, we confirm the conventional wisdom that it is impossible to create an accurate distance-based threshold for defining taxonomic levels and instead advocate for a consensus-based method of classifying OTUs. Second, using a taxonomic-independent approach, we show that the average neighbor clustering algorithm produces more robust OTUs than other hierarchical and heuristic clustering algorithms. Third, we demonstrate several steps to reduce the computational burden of forming OTUs without sacrificing the robustness of the OTU assignment. Finally, by blending these solutions, we propose a new heuristic that has a minimal effect on the robustness of OTUs and significantly reduces the necessary time and memory requirements. The ability to quickly and accurately assign sequences to OTUs and then obtain taxonomic information for those OTUs will greatly improve OTU-based analyses and overcome many of the challenges encountered with phylotype-based methods.","title":"Assessing and improving methods used in operational taxonomic unit-based approaches for 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21421784"},
{"description":"Authors: Potapov, V., Cohen, M., and Schreiber, G.<br><br>Abstract: Methods for protein modeling and design advanced rapidly in recent years. At the heart of these computational methods is an energy function that calculates the free energy of the system. Many of these functions were also developed to estimate the consequence of mutation on protein stability or binding affinity. In the current study, we chose six different methods that were previously reported as being able to predict the change in protein stability (DeltaDeltaG) upon mutation: CC/PBSA, EGAD, FoldX, I-Mutant2.0, Rosetta and Hunter. We evaluated their performance on a large set of 2156 single mutations, avoiding for each program the mutations used for training. The correlation coefficients between experimental and predicted DeltaDeltaG values were in the range of 0.59 for the best and 0.26 for the worst performing method. All the tested computational methods showed a correct trend in their predictions, but failed in providing the precise values. This is not due to lack in precision of the experimental data, which showed a correlation coefficient of 0.86 between different measurements. Combining the methods did not significantly improve prediction accuracy compared to a single method. These results suggest that there is still room for improvement, which is crucial if we want forcefields to perform better in their various tasks.","title":"Assessing computational methods for predicting protein stability upon mutation: good on average but not in the details","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19561092"},

{"description":"Authors: Gaspar, J.M., and Thomas, W.K.<br><br>Abstract: Early marker-based metagenomic studies were performed without properly accounting for the effects of noise (sequencing errors, PCR single-base errors, and PCR chimeras). Denoising algorithms have been developed, but they were validated using data derived from mock communities, in which the true sequences were known. Since the algorithms were designed to be used in real community studies, it is important to evaluate the results in such cases. With this goal in mind, we processed a real 16S rRNA metagenomic dataset through five denoising pipelines. By reconstituting the sequence reads at each stage of the pipelines, we determined how the reads were being altered. In one denoising pipeline, AmpliconNoise, we found that the algorithm that was designed to remove pyrosequencing errors changed the reads in a manner inconsistent with the known spectrum of these errors, until one of the parameters was increased substantially from its default value. Additionally, because the longest read was picked as the representative for each cluster, sequences were added to the 3' ends of shorter reads that were often dissimilar from what had been removed by the truncations of the previous filtering step. In QIIME, the denoising algorithm caused a much larger number of changes to the reads unless the parameters were changed from their defaults. The denoising pipeline in mothur avoided some of these negative side-effects because of its strict default filtering criteria, but these criteria also greatly limited the sequence information produced at the end of the pipeline. We recommend that those using these denoising pipelines be cognizant of these issues and examine how their reads are being transformed by the denoising process as a component of their analysis.","title":"Assessing the consequences of denoising marker-based metagenomic data","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23536909"},

Affymetrix GeneChip whole genome sampling analysis (WGSA) combined with 100 K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays is one of several microarray-based approaches that are now being used to detect such structural genomic changes.

However, it remains a significant challenge to identify cancer-driving mutations, since most observed missense changes are neutral passenger mutations. Various computational methods have been developed to predict the effects of amino acid substitutions on protein function and classify mutations as deleterious or benign. These include approaches that rely on evolutionary conservation, structural constraints, or physicochemical attributes of amino acid substitutions. Here we review existing methods and further examine eight tools: SIFT, PolyPhen2, Condel, CHASM, mCluster, logRE, SNAP, and MutationAssessor, with respect to their coverage, accuracy, availability and dependence on other tools.<br>RESULTS: Single nucleotide polymorphisms with high minor allele frequencies were used as a negative (neutral) set for testing, and recurrent mutations from the COSMIC database as well as novel recurrent somatic mutations identified in very recent cancer studies were used as positive (non-neutral) sets. Conservation-based methods generally had moderately high accuracy in distinguishing neutral from deleterious mutations, whereas the performance of machine learning based predictors with comprehensive feature spaces varied between assessments using different positive sets. MutationAssessor consistently provided the highest accuracies. For certain combinations metapredictors slightly improved the performance of included individual methods, but did not outperform MutationAssessor as stand-alone tool.<br>CONCLUSIONS: Our independent assessment of existing tools reveals various performance disparities. Cancer-trained methods did not improve upon more general predictors. No method or combination of methods exceeds 81% accuracy, indicating there is still significant room for improvement for driver mutation prediction, and perhaps more sophisticated feature integration is needed to develop a more robust tool.","title":"Assessment of computational methods for predicting the effects of missense mutations in human cancers","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23819521"},

We report the results of a reliability analysis comparing data from 96 pairs of samples processed with CNVpartition, PennCNV, and QuantiSNP for Infinium Illumina Human 1Million probe chip data. We also performed a validity assessment with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) as a reference standard. The number of CNVs per individual varied according to the calling algorithm. Higher numbers of CNVs were detected in saliva than in blood DNA samples regardless of the algorithm used. All algorithms presented low agreement with mean Kappa Index (KI) &lt;66. PennCNV was the most reliable algorithm (KI(w=) 98.96) when assessing the number of copies. The agreement observed in detecting CNV was higher in blood than in saliva samples. When comparing to MLPA, all algorithms identified poorly known copy aberrations (sensitivity = 0.19-0.28). In contrast, specificity was very high (0.97-0.99). Once a CNV was detected, the number of copies was truly assessed (sensitivity &gt;0.62).

It allows us to gain an insight into the functional working mechanism of cells beyond the detection of differently expressed gene sets. In order to evaluate the competence of GSA approaches, three self-contained GSA approaches with different statistical methods were chosen; Category, Globaltest and Hotelling's T(2) together with their assayed power to identify the differences expressed via simulation and real microarray data. The Category does not take care of the correlation structure, while the other two deal with correlations. In order to perform these methods, R and Bioconductor were used. Furthermore, venous thromboembolism and acute lymphoblastic leukemia microarray data were applied. The results of three GSAs showed that the competence of these methods depends on the distribution of gene expression in a dataset. It is very important to assay the distribution of gene expression data before choosing the GSA method to identify gene sets differently expressed between phenotypes. On the other hand, assessment of common genes among significant gene sets indicated that there was a significant agreement between the result of GSA and the findings of biologists.","title":"Assessment of gene set analysis methods based on microarray data","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24012817"},
{"description":"Author: Turner, F.S.<br><br>Abstract: The Illumina NexteraXT transposon protocol is a cost effective way to generate paired end libraries. However, the resulting insert size is highly sensitive to the concentration of DNA used, and the variation of insert sizes is often large. One consequence of this is some fragments may have an insert shorter than the length of a single read, particularly where the library is designed to produce overlapping paired end reads in order to produce longer continuous sequences. Such small insert sizes mean fewer longer reads, and also result in the presence of adapter at the end of the read. Here is presented a protocol to use publicly available tools to identify read pairs with small insert sizes and so likely to contain adapter, to check the sequence of the adapter, and remove adapter sequence from the reads. This protocol does not require a reference genome or prior knowledge of the sequence to be trimmed. Whilst the presence of fragments with small insert sizes may be a particular problem for NexteraXT libraries, the principle can be applied to any Illumina dataset in which the presence of such small inserts is suspected.","title":"Assessment of insert sizes and adapter content in fastq data from NexteraXT libraries","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24523726"},

Molecular docking is a rational structural approach employed to predict thermodynamic parameters based on molecular recognition between two or more molecules. In addition, docking studies have become very important for therapeutic applications in modern structure-based drug design because this computational tool uses few economic resources. However, they omit many biological conditions that critically influence small and macromolecular structural motions. To mimic physiological conditions, it is necessary to consider other environmental factors, such as the presence of water molecules and the flexibility of ligands and side chain residues of proteins. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations have been coupled with docking procedures to expand the boundaries and obtain more reliable information.<br>AREAS COVERED: In this article, we review current advances in protein-small molecule docking and possible future directions.<br>EXPERT OPINION: Docking studies include many conformations to predict binding free energies (scoring functions) and to search (scoring sampling) for the most representative binding conformations. Therefore, several biological properties, from side chain residues to complete protein motions, have been included in docking studies to improve theoretical predictions.","title":"Automated docking for novel drug discovery","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23642085"},

{"description":"Author: Friedberg, I.<br><br>Abstract: Overwhelmed with genomic data, biologists are facing the first big post-genomic question--what do all genes do? First, not only is the volume of pure sequence and structure data growing, but its diversity is growing as well, leading to a disproportionate growth in the number of uncharacterized gene products. Consequently, established methods of gene and protein annotation, such as homology-based transfer, are annotating less data and in many cases are amplifying existing erroneous annotation. Second, there is a need for a functional annotation which is standardized and machine readable so that function prediction programs could be incorporated into larger workflows. This is problematic due to the subjective and contextual definition of protein function. Third, there is a need to assess the quality of function predictors. Again, the subjectivity of the term 'function' and the various aspects of biological function make this a challenging effort. This article briefly outlines the history of automated protein function prediction and surveys the latest innovations in all three topics.","title":"Automated protein function prediction--the genomic challenge","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16772267"},
{"description":"Authors: Surinova, S., Huttenhain, R., Chang, C.Y., Espona, L., Vitek, O., and Aebersold, R.<br><br>Abstract: Targeted proteomics based on selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry is commonly used for accurate and reproducible quantification of protein analytes in complex biological mixtures. Strictly hypothesis-driven, SRM assays quantify each targeted protein by collecting measurements on its peptide fragment ions, called transitions. To achieve sensitive and accurate quantitative results, experimental design and data analysis must consistently account for the variability of the quantified transitions. This consistency is especially important in large experiments, which increasingly require profiling up to hundreds of proteins over hundreds of samples. Here we describe a robust and automated workflow for the analysis of large quantitative SRM data sets that integrates data processing, statistical protein identification and quantification, and dissemination of the results. The integrated workflow combines three software tools: mProphet for peptide identification via probabilistic scoring; SRMstats for protein significance analysis with linear mixed-effect models; and PASSEL, a public repository for storage, retrieval and query of SRM data. The input requirements for the protocol are files with SRM traces in mzXML format, and a file with a list of transitions in a text tab-separated format. The protocol is especially suited for data with heavy isotope-labeled peptide internal standards. We demonstrate the protocol on a clinical data set in which the abundances of 35 biomarker candidates were profiled in 83 blood plasma samples of subjects with ovarian cancer or benign ovarian tumors. The time frame to realize the protocol is 1-2 weeks, depending on the number of replicates used in the experiment.","title":"Automated selected reaction monitoring data analysis workflow for large-scale targeted proteomic studies","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23887179"},

This process is very challenging due to the diverse sources of information resulting from genomics experiments. In this work, we review methods designed to combine genomic data recorded from microarray gene expression (MAGE) experiments. It has been acknowledged that the main source of variation between different MAGE datasets is due to the so-called 'batch effects'. The methods reviewed here perform data integration by removing (or more precisely attempting to remove) the unwanted variation associated with batch effects. They are presented in a unified framework together with a wide range of evaluation tools, which are mandatory in assessing the efficiency and the quality of the data integration process. We provide a systematic description of the MAGE data integration methodology together with some basic recommendation to help the users in choosing the appropriate tools to integrate MAGE data for large-scale analysis; and also how to evaluate them from different perspectives in order to quantify their efficiency.

It addresses two basic questions: (i) among a subset of structures, what sequences are compatible with the conformation of my query, (ii) are there conformations similar to my query in other proteins, is it observed elsewhere ? BCSearch is based on a new similarity approach, based on a Binet Cauchy (BC) kernel. The approach measures the correlation between the volumes of all the tetraedron of the query and that of a target. The similarity (BCscore) is scored between -1 and 1, where a value of 1 corresponds to the exact same conformation than the query, and -1 to the mirror conformation. Values close to 0 correspond to unrelated fragments. The BCscore is more stringent than other criteria such as the alpha carbon RMS deviation. Particularly, fragments with partly dissimilar shapes are poorly scored and consequently collections of matches are usually less noisy, which makes them better suited for the analysis of the local structure-sequence relationship. In addition, since no superimposition is required, the similarity search is very fast, making possible to mine large collections of structures.","title":"BCSearch","url":"http://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/services/BCSearch/"},

For example, in contrast to arrays, RNA-Seq is expected to be able to provide accurate identification and quantification of full-length transcripts. A number of methods have been developed for this purpose, but short error prone reads makes it a difficult problem in practice. It is essential to determine which algorithms perform best, and where and why they fail. However, there is a dearth of independent and unbiased benchmarking studies of these algorithms. Here we take an approach using both simulated and experimental benchmark data to evaluate their accuracy. We conclude that most methods are inaccurate even using idealized data, and that no is method sufficiently accurate once complicating factors such as polymorphisms, intron signal, sequencing error, and multiple splice forms are present. These results point to the pressing need for further algorithm development.","title":"Benchmark Analysis of Algorithms for Determining and Quantifying Full-length mRNA Splice Forms from RNA-Seq Data","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/007088"},

Ab initio methods have become popular in computational miRNA detection. Most software tools are designed to distinguish miRNA precursors from pseudo-hairpins, but a few can mine miRNA from genome or expressed sequence tag sequences. We prepared novel testing datasets to measure and compare the performance of various software tools. Furthermore, we summarized the miRNA mining methods that study next-generation sequencing data for bioinformatics researchers who are analyzing these data. Because secondary structure is an important feature in the identification of miRNA, we analyzed the influence of various secondary structure prediction software tools on miRNA identification. MiPred was the most effective for classifying real-/pseudo-pre-miRNA sequences, and miRAbela performed relatively better for mining miRNA precursors from genome or expressed sequence tag sequences.

Here we test capabilities of RosettaDock 3.2, part of the newly developed Rosetta v3.2 modeling suite, against Docking Benchmark 3.0, and compare it with RosettaDock v2.3, the latest version of the previous Rosetta software package. The benchmark contains a diverse set of 116 docking targets including 22 antibody-antigen complexes, 33 enzyme-inhibitor complexes, and 60 'other' complexes. These targets were further classified by expected docking difficulty into 84 rigid-body targets, 17 medium targets, and 14 difficult targets. We carried out local docking perturbations for each target, using the unbound structures when available, in both RosettaDock v2.3 and v3.2. Overall the performances of RosettaDock v2.3 and v3.2 were similar. RosettaDock v3.2 achieved 56 docking funnels, compared to 49 in v2.3. A breakdown of docking performance by protein complex type shows that RosettaDock v3.2 achieved docking funnels for 63% of antibody-antigen targets, 62% of enzyme-inhibitor targets, and 35% of 'other' targets. In terms of docking difficulty, RosettaDock v3.2 achieved funnels for 58% of rigid-body targets, 30% of medium targets, and 14% of difficult targets. For targets that failed, we carry out additional analyses to identify the cause of failure, which showed that binding-induced backbone conformation changes account for a majority of failures. We also present a bootstrap statistical analysis that quantifies the reliability of the stochastic docking results. Finally, we demonstrate the additional functionality available in RosettaDock v3.2 by incorporating small-molecules and non-protein co-factors in docking of a smaller target set. This study marks the most extensive benchmarking of the RosettaDock module to date and establishes a baseline for future research in protein interface modeling and structure prediction.","title":"Benchmarking and analysis of protein docking performance in Rosetta v3.2","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21829626"},

After examining more than 10(6) combinations, we found that even the best set of scales and parameters performed only marginally better than random. Our results confirm the null hypothesis: Single-scale amino acid propensity profiles cannot be used to predict epitope location reliably.

Hence, methods to identify the likely pathogenic mutations that are worth exploring experimentally and clinically are required. We sought to compare the performance of 15 mutation effect prediction algorithms and their agreement. As a hypothesis-generating aim, we sought to define whether combinations of prediction algorithms would improve the functional effect predictions of specific mutations.<br>RESULTS: Literature and database mining of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) affecting 15 cancer genes was performed to identify mutations supported by functional evidence or hereditary disease association to be classified either as non-neutral (n = 849) or neutral (n = 140) with respect to their impact on protein function. These SNVs were employed to test the performance of 15 mutation effect prediction algorithms. The accuracy of the prediction algorithms varies considerably. Although all algorithms perform consistently well in terms of positive predictive value, their negative predictive value varies substantially. Cancer-specific mutation effect predictors display no-to-almost perfect agreement in their predictions of these SNVs, whereas the non-cancer-specific predictors showed no-to-moderate agreement. Combinations of predictors modestly improve accuracy and significantly improve negative predictive values.<br>CONCLUSIONS: The information provided by mutation effect predictors is not equivalent. No algorithm is able to predict sufficiently accurately SNVs that should be taken forward for experimental or clinical testing. Combining algorithms aggregates orthogonal information and may result in improvements in the negative predictive value of mutation effect predictions.","title":"Benchmarking mutation effect prediction algorithms using functionally validated cancer-related missense mutations","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25348012"},
{"description":"Authors: Schirmer, M., Sloan, W.T., and Quince, C.<br><br>Abstract: Viral haplotype reconstruction from a set of observed reads is one of the most challenging problems in bioinformatics today. Next-generation sequencing technologies enable us to detect single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of haplotypes-even if the haplotypes appear at low frequencies. However, there are two major problems. First, we need to distinguish real SNPs from sequencing errors. Second, we need to determine which SNPs occur on the same haplotype, which cannot be inferred from the reads if the distance between SNPs on a haplotype exceeds the read length. We conducted an independent benchmarking study that directly compares the currently available viral haplotype reconstruction programmes. We also present nine in silico data sets that we generated to reflect biologically plausible populations. For these data sets, we simulated 454 and Illumina reads and applied the programmes to test their capacity to reconstruct whole genomes and individual genes. We developed a novel statistical framework to demonstrate the strengths and limitations of the programmes. Our benchmarking demonstrated that all the programmes we tested performed poorly when sequence divergence was low and failed to recover haplotype populations with rare haplotypes.","title":"Benchmarking of viral haplotype reconstruction programmes: an overview of the capacities and limitations of currently available programmes","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23257116"},
{"description":"Author: Martin, J.<br><br>Abstract: A number of predictive methods have been developed to predict protein-protein binding sites. Each new method is traditionally benchmarked using sets of protein structures of various sizes, and global statistics are used to assess the quality of the prediction. Little attention has been paid to the potential bias due to protein size on these statistics. Indeed, small proteins involve proportionally more residues at interfaces than large ones. If a predictive method is biased toward small proteins, this can lead to an over-estimation of its performance. Here, we investigate the bias due to the size effect when benchmarking protein-protein interface prediction on the widely used docking benchmark 4.0. First, we simulate random scores that favor small proteins over large ones. Instead of the 0.5 AUC (Area Under the Curve) value expected by chance, these biased scores result in an AUC equal to 0.6 using hypergeometric distributions, and up to 0.65 using constant scores. We then use real prediction results to illustrate how to detect the size bias by shuffling, and subsequently correct it using a simple conversion of the scores into normalized ranks. In addition, we investigate the scores produced by eight published methods and show that they are all affected by the size effect, which can change their relative ranking. The size effect also has an impact on linear combination scores by modifying the relative contributions of each method. In the future, systematic corrections should be applied when benchmarking predictive methods using data sets with mixed protein sizes.","title":"Benchmarking protein-protein interface predictions: why you should care about protein size","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24420747"},
{"description":"Authors: Chandramohan, R., Wu, P.Y., Phan, J.H., and Wang, M.D.<br><br>Abstract: RNA-Seq, a deep sequencing technique, promises to be a potential successor to microarrays for studying the transcriptome. One of many aspects of transcriptomics that are of interest to researchers is gene expression estimation. With rapid development in RNA-Seq, there are numerous tools available to estimate gene expression, each producing different results. However, we do not know which of these tools produces the most accurate gene expression estimates. In this study we have addressed this issue using Cufflinks, IsoEM, HTSeq, and RSEM to quantify RNA-Seq expression profiles. Comparing results of these quantification tools, we observe that RNA-Seq relative expression estimates correlate with RT-qPCR measurements in the range of 0.85 to 0.89, with HTSeq exhibiting the highest correlation. But, in terms of root-mean-square deviation of RNA-Seq relative expression estimates from RT-qPCR measurements, we find HTSeq to produce the greatest deviation. Therefore, we conclude that, though Cufflinks, RSEM, and IsoEM might not correlate as well as HTSeq with RT-qPCR measurements, they may produce expression values with higher accuracy.","title":"Benchmarking RNA-Seq quantification tools","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24109770"},
{"description":"Authors: Hatem, A., Bozdag, D., Toland, A.E., and Catalyurek, U.V.<br><br>Abstract: BACKGROUND: The development of next-generation sequencing instruments has led to the generation of millions of short sequences in a single run. The process of aligning these reads to a reference genome is time consuming and demands the development of fast and accurate alignment tools. However, the current proposed tools make different compromises between the accuracy and the speed of mapping. Moreover, many important aspects are overlooked while comparing the performance of a newly developed tool to the state of the art. Therefore, there is a need for an objective evaluation method that covers all the aspects. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking suite to extensively analyze sequencing tools with respect to various aspects and provide an objective comparison.<br>RESULTS: We applied our benchmarking tests on 9 well known mapping tools, namely, Bowtie, Bowtie2, BWA, SOAP2, MAQ, RMAP, GSNAP, Novoalign, and mrsFAST (mrFAST) using synthetic data and real RNA-Seq data. MAQ and RMAP are based on building hash tables for the reads, whereas the remaining tools are based on indexing the reference genome. The benchmarking tests reveal the strengths and weaknesses of each tool. The results show that no single tool outperforms all others in all metrics. However, Bowtie maintained the best throughput for most of the tests while BWA performed better for longer read lengths. The benchmarking tests are not restricted to the mentioned tools and can be further applied to others.<br>CONCLUSION: The mapping process is still a hard problem that is affected by many factors. In this work, we provided a benchmarking suite that reveals and evaluates the different factors affecting the mapping process. Still, there is no tool that outperforms all of the others in all the tests. Therefore, the end user should clearly specify his needs in order to choose the tool that provides the best results.","title":"Benchmarking short sequence mapping tools","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23758764"},

The development of methods for pathway inference from metagenomics data is of paramount importance to link a phenotype to a cascade of events stemming from a series of connected sets of genes or proteins. Biochemical and regulatory pathways have until recently been thought and modelled within one cell type, one organism, one species. This vision is being dramatically changed by the advent of whole microbiome sequencing studies, revealing the role of symbiotic microbial populations in fundamental biochemical functions. The new landscape we face requires a clear picture of the potentialities of existing tools and development of new tools to characterize, reconstruct and model biochemical and regulatory pathways as the result of integration of function in complex symbiotic interactions of ontologically and evolutionary distinct cell types.","title":"Bioinformatic approaches for functional annotation and pathway inference in metagenomics data","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23175748"},
{"description":"Authors: Dosztanyi, Z., Meszaros, B., and Simon, I.<br><br>Abstract: Intrinsically disordered/unstructured proteins exist without a stable three-dimensional (3D) structure as highly flexible conformational ensembles. The available genome sequences revealed that these proteins are surprisingly common and their frequency reaches high proportions in eukaryotes. Due to their vital role in various biological processes including signaling and regulation and their involvement in various diseases, disordered proteins and protein segments are the focus of many biochemical, molecular biological, pathological and pharmaceutical studies. These proteins are difficult to study experimentally because of the lack of unique structure in the isolated form. Their amino acid sequence, however, is available, and can be used for their identification and characterization by bioinformatic tools, analogously to globular proteins. In this review, we first present a small survey of current methods to identify disordered proteins or protein segments, focusing on those that are publicly available as web servers. In more detail we also discuss approaches that predict disordered regions and specific regions involved in protein binding by modeling the physical background of protein disorder. In our review we argue that the heterogeneity of disordered segments needs to be taken into account for a better understanding of protein disorder.","title":"Bioinformatical approaches to characterize intrinsically disordered/unstructured proteins","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20007729"},
{"description":"Authors: Guidolin, D., Agnati, L.F., Albertin, G., Tortorella, C., and Fuxe, K.<br><br>Abstract: Conformational protein diseases of the human central nervous system represent a subject that has crucial theoretical and medical implications. They include several important neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's and Creutzfeldt-Jacob's diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the tauopathies. They occur when soluble proteins undergo conformational rearrangements becoming capable of aggregate into beta-sheets conformations leading to the production of insoluble complexes known as amyloid deposits, that accumulate and lead to neurons and glial cells death. Theoretical and experimental evidence indicates that a key role in the conformational changes leading to amyloid formation is played by short sequence stretches within a given protein. Thus, the identification of protein regions potentially involved in aggregate formation and the characterization of their properties are relevant questions in the study of conformational proteins diseases. To address these questions, bioinformatics methods might provide an important contribution, suggesting possible mechanisms of protein aggregation, and focusing and orienting the experimental work. Thus, in the first part of the present review bioinformatics methods specifically attempting to predict aggregation-prone regions in proteins will be briefly described. Furthermore, the results provided by the combined use of some of them to analyze a set of particularly important proteins involved in human degenerative diseases will be discussed.","title":"Bioinformatics aggregation predictors in the study of protein conformational diseases of the human nervous system","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23161174"},

The functions of membrane proteins have been investigated with several computational approaches, such as developing databases, analyzing the structure-function relationship and establishing algorithms to discriminate different type of membrane proteins. However, compilation of bioinformatics resources for the functions of membrane proteins is not well documented compared with their structural aspects. In this comprehensive review, we elaborately focus on three aspects of membrane protein functions: (i) databases for different types of membrane proteins based on their functions including transporters, receptors and ion channels, annotated functional data for genomes, as well as functionally important amino acid residues in membrane proteins obtained from experimental data, (ii) analysis of membrane protein functions based on their structures, motifs, amino acid properties and other features and (iii) algorithms for discriminating different types of membrane proteins and annotating them in genomic sequences.

Approximately 68 bioinformatics enrichment tools that are currently available in the community are collected in this survey. Tools are uniquely categorized into three major classes, according to their underlying enrichment algorithms. The comprehensive collections, unique tool classifications and associated questions/issues will provide a more comprehensive and up-to-date view regarding the advantages, pitfalls and recent trends in a simpler tool-class level rather than by a tool-by-tool approach.

Mass spectrometry provides a means to detect hundreds of lipids in parallel, and this includes low abundance species of lipids. Nevertheless, frequently occurring isobaric and isomeric lipid species complicate lipidomics analyses from an analytical and bioinformatics perspective. Various MS/MS strategies have evolved to resolve ambiguous identifications of lipid species, and these strategies have been supported by corresponding bioinformatics analysis tools. This review intends to familiarize readers with available bioinformatics MS/MS analysis tools and databases, the structural information obtainable from these, and their applicability to different MS/MS strategies. Finally, future challenges in detecting double bond positions are investigated from a bioinformatics perspective.","title":"Bioinformatics tools and challenges in structural analysis of lipidomics MS/MS data","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22764120"},

{"description":"Authors: Caccia, D., Dugo, M., Callari, M., and Bongarzone, I.<br><br>Abstract: Over recent years, analyses of secretomes (complete sets of secreted proteins) have been reported in various organisms, cell types, and pathologies and such studies are quickly gaining popularity. Fungi secrete enzymes can break down potential food sources; plant secreted proteins are primarily parts of the cell wall proteome; and human secreted proteins are involved in cellular immunity and communication, and provide useful information for the discovery of novel biomarkers, such as for cancer diagnosis. Continuous development of methodologies supports the wide identification and quantification of secreted proteins in a given cellular state. The role of secreted factors is also investigated in the context of the regulation of major signaling events, and connectivity maps are built to describe the differential expression and dynamic changes of secretomes. Bioinformatics has become the bridge between secretome data and computational tasks for managing, mining, and retrieving information. Predictions can be made based on this information, contributing to the elucidation of a given organism's physiological state and the determination of the specific malfunction in disease states. Here we provide an overview of the available bioinformatics databases and software that are used to analyze the biological meaning of secretome data, including descriptions of the main functions and limitations of these tools. The important challenges of data analysis are mainly related to the integration of biological information from dissimilar sources. Improvements in databases and developments in software will likely substantially contribute to the usefulness and reliability of secretome studies.

{"description":"Authors: Mayne, S.L., and Patterton, H.G.<br><br>Abstract: Multi-subunit protein complexes are involved in many essential biochemical processes including signal transduction, protein synthesis, RNA synthesis, DNA replication and protein degradation. An accurate description of the relative structural arrangement of the constituent subunits in such complexes is crucial for an understanding of the molecular mechanism of the complex as a whole. Many complexes, however, lie in the mega-Dalton range, and are not amenable to X-ray crystallographic or nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. Techniques that are suited to structural studies of such large complexes, such as cryo-electron microscopy, do not provide the resolution required for a mechanistic insight. Mass spectrometry (MS) has increasingly been applied to identify the residues that are involved in chemical cross-links in compound protein assemblies, and have provided valuable insight into the molecular arrangement, orientation and contact surfaces of subunits within such large complexes. This approach is known as MS3D, and involves the MS analysis of cross-linked di-peptides following the enzymatic cleavage of a chemically cross-linked complex. A major challenge of this approach is the identification of the cross-linked di-peptides in a composite mixture of peptides, as well as the identification of the residues involved in the cross-link. These analyses require bioinformatics tools with capabilities beyond that of general, MS-based proteomic analysis software. Many MS3D software tools have appeared, often designed for very specific experimental methods. Here, we provide a review of all major MS3D bioinformatics programmes, reviewing their applicability to different workflows, specific experimental requirements and the computational approach taken by each.","title":"Bioinformatics tools for the structural elucidation of multi-subunit protein complexes by mass spectrometric analysis of protein-protein cross-links","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22101029"},

It is necessary to be able to combine data from all available resources to judge the functionality, complexity and completeness of any given network overall, but especially the full integration of relevant information from the scientific literature is still an ongoing and complex task. Currently, the text-mining research community is steadily moving towards processing the full body of the scientific literature by making use of rich linguistic features such as full text parsing, to extract biological interactions. The next step will be to combine these with information from scientific databases to support hypothesis generation for the discovery of new knowledge and the extension of biological networks. The generation of comprehensive networks requires technologies such as entity grounding, coordination resolution and co-reference resolution, which are not fully solved and are required to further improve the quality of results.

Study of biological network motifs may reveal answers to many important biological questions. The main difficulty in detecting larger network motifs in biological networks lies in the facts that the number of possible sub-graphs increases exponentially with the network or motif size (node counts, in general), and that no known polynomial-time algorithm exists in deciding if two graphs are topologically equivalent. This article discusses the biological significance of network motifs, the motivation behind solving the motif-finding problem, and strategies to solve the various aspects of this problem. A simple classification scheme is designed to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of several existing algorithms.

We demonstrate technical improvements for library preparation and bioinformatic analyses that can be done in standard laboratories. We find that decoupling amplification of bisulfite converted (bis) DNA from the indexing reaction is an advantage, specifically in reducing total PCR cycle number and pre-selecting high quality bis-libraries. We also introduce a progressive PCR method for optimal library amplification and size-selection. At the sequencing stage, we thoroughly test the benefits of pooling non-bis DNA library with bis-libraries and find that BisSeq libraries can be pooled with a high proportion of non-bis DNA libraries with minimal impact on BisSeq output. For informatics analysis, we propose a series of optimization steps including the utilization of the mitochondrial genome as a QC standard, and we assess the validity of using duplicate reads for coverage statistics.<br>CONCLUSION: We demonstrate several quality control checkpoints at the library preparation, pre-sequencing, post-sequencing, and post-alignment stages, which should prove useful in determining sample and processing quality. We also determine that including a significant portion of non-bisulfite converted DNA with bisulfite converted DNA has a minimal impact on usable bisulfite read output.","title":"BisQC: an operational pipeline for multiplexed bisulfite sequencing","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24734894"},

{"description":"Author: Smith, D.R.<br><br>Abstract: Advancements in high-throughput nucleotide sequencing techniques have brought with them state-of-the-art bioinformatics programs and software packages. Given the importance of molecular sequence data in contemporary life science research, these software suites are becoming an essential component of many labs and classrooms, and as such are frequently designed for non-computer specialists and marketed as one-stop bioinformatics toolkits. Although beautifully designed and powerful, user-friendly bioinformatics packages can be expensive and, as more arrive on the market each year, it can be difficult for researchers, teachers and students to choose the right software for their needs, especially if they do not have a bioinformatics background. This review highlights some of the currently available and most popular commercial bioinformatics packages, discussing their prices, usability, features and suitability for teaching. Although several commercial bioinformatics programs are arguably overpriced and overhyped, many are well designed, sophisticated and, in my opinion, worth the investment. If you are just beginning your foray into molecular sequence analysis or an experienced genomicist, I encourage you to explore proprietary software bundles. They have the potential to streamline your research, increase your productivity, energize your classroom and, if anything, add a bit of zest to the often dry detached world of bioinformatics.","title":"Buying in to bioinformatics: an introduction to commercial sequence analysis software","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25183247"},

Probe-target hybridization is the central concept of this technology to determine the relative abundance of nucleic acid sequences through fluorescence-based detection. In microarray experiments, variations of expression measurements can be attributed to many different sources that influence the stability and reproducibility of microarray platforms. Normalization is an essential step to reduce non-biological errors and to convert raw image data from multiple arrays (channels) to quality data for further analysis. In general, for the traditional microarray analysis, most established normalization methods are based on two assumptions: (1) the total number of target genes is large enough (&gt;10,000); and (2) the expression level of the majority of genes is kept constant. However, microRNA (miRNA) arrays are usually spotted in low density, due to the fact that the total number of miRNAs is less than 2,000 and the majority of miRNAs are weakly or not expressed. As a result, normalization methods based on the above two assumptions are not applicable to miRNA profiling studies. In this review, we discuss a few representative microarray platforms on the market for miRNA profiling and compare the traditional methods with a few novel strategies specific for miRNA microarrays.","title":"Challenges for MicroRNA Microarray Data Analysis","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24163754"},

Under normal circumstances, these microbes help us to digest our food and to maintain our immune systems, but dysfunction of the human microbiota has been linked to conditions ranging from inflammatory bowel disease to antibiotic-resistant infections. Modern high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic tools provide a powerful means of understanding the contribution of the human microbiome to health and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions. This chapter will first discuss the historical origins of microbiome studies and methods for determining the ecological diversity of a microbial community. Next, it will introduce shotgun sequencing technologies such as metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, the computational challenges and methods associated with these data, and how they enable microbiome analysis. Finally, it will conclude with examples of the functional genomics of the human microbiome and its influences upon health and disease.","title":"Chapter 12: Human microbiome analysis","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23300406"},
{"description":"Author: Bromberg, Y.<br><br>Abstract: Disease-causing aberrations in the normal function of a gene define that gene as a disease gene. Proving a causal link between a gene and a disease experimentally is expensive and time-consuming. Comprehensive prioritization of candidate genes prior to experimental testing drastically reduces the associated costs. Computational gene prioritization is based on various pieces of correlative evidence that associate each gene with the given disease and suggest possible causal links. A fair amount of this evidence comes from high-throughput experimentation. Thus, well-developed methods are necessary to reliably deal with the quantity of information at hand. Existing gene prioritization techniques already significantly improve the outcomes of targeted experimental studies. Faster and more reliable techniques that account for novel data types are necessary for the development of new diagnostics, treatments, and cure for many diseases.","title":"Chapter 15: disease gene prioritization","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23633938"},

We review several kernel-based statistical methods from two different viewpoints: binary classification and dimension reduction. In the results, we demonstrate the usefulness of the methods on the prediction of drug-target interactions from chemical structure data and genomic sequence data.

The ChIP-chip signals can be obtained over the whole genome by tiling arrays, where a peak shape is generally observed around a protein-binding site. In this article, we describe the ChIP-chip process and present a probability model for ChIP-chip data.

{"description":"Authors: Badr, G., Al-Turaiki, I., and Mathkour, H.<br><br>Abstract: BACKGROUND: Motif discovery is the problem of finding recurring patterns in biological data. Patterns can be sequential, mainly when discovered in DNA sequences. They can also be structural (e.g. when discovering RNA motifs). Finding common structural patterns helps to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of action (e.g. post-transcriptional regulation). Unlike DNA motifs, which are sequentially conserved, RNA motifs exhibit conservation in structure, which may be common even if the sequences are different. Over the past few years, hundreds of algorithms have been developed to solve the sequential motif discovery problem, while less work has been done for the structural case.<br>METHODS: In this paper, we survey, classify, and compare different algorithms that solve the structural motif discovery problem, where the underlying sequences may be different. We highlight their strengths and weaknesses. We start by proposing a benchmark dataset and a measurement tool that can be used to evaluate different motif discovery approaches. Then, we proceed by proposing our experimental setup. Finally, results are obtained using the proposed benchmark to compare available tools. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to compare tools solely designed for structural motif discovery.<br>RESULTS: Results show that the accuracy of discovered motifs is relatively low. The results also suggest a complementary behavior among tools where some tools perform well on simple structures, while other tools are better for complex structures.<br>CONCLUSIONS: We have classified and evaluated the performance of available structural motif discovery tools. In addition, we have proposed a benchmark dataset with tools that can be used to evaluate newly developed tools.","title":"Classification and assessment tools for structural motif discovery algorithms","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23902564"},
{"description":"Authors: Mande, S.S., Mohammed, M.H., and Ghosh, T.S.<br><br>Abstract: Characterizing the taxonomic diversity of microbial communities is one of the primary objectives of metagenomic studies. Taxonomic analysis of microbial communities, a process referred to as binning, is challenging for the following reasons. Primarily, query sequences originating from the genomes of most microbes in an environmental sample lack taxonomically related sequences in existing reference databases. This absence of a taxonomic context makes binning a very challenging task. Limitations of current sequencing platforms, with respect to short read lengths and sequencing errors/artifacts, are also key factors that determine the overall binning efficiency. Furthermore, the sheer volume of metagenomic datasets also demands highly efficient algorithms that can operate within reasonable requirements of compute power. This review discusses the premise, methodologies, advantages, limitations and challenges of various methods available for binning of metagenomic datasets obtained using the shotgun sequencing approach. Various parameters as well as strategies used for evaluating binning efficiency are then reviewed.","title":"Classification of metagenomic sequences: methods and challenges","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22962338"},

{"description":"Cancer arises from initiating cells (clones) that undergo intense evolutionary selection during disease progression and can be widely altered during treatment. The tumor cell evolutionary process may lead to subclonal divergence resulting in genetic and molecular heterogeneity. Computational approaches to establish maps of cancer evolution would assist in determining the progression status of each patient tumor and possibly inform treatment strategies. Technical challenges related to tumor DNA purity and cancer cell ploidy have been addressed but critical aspects remain for minimally aberrant or highly heterogeneous tumors. Available tools all apply a global use of the genome data to infer tumor DNA purity and tumor ploidy. Global approaches are well-suited for tumor samples with fairly homogenous genomic aberrations (high ratio of clonal versus subclonal lesions). In the clinical setting where tumor samples might exhibit heterogeneity due to progression or subsequent to multiple lines of treatment and/or for tumor types that undergo complex structural changes, global approaches may prove sub-optimal as they undermine the genomic diversity. CLONET belongs to a second generation of tools based on local (in contrast to global) optimization where estimates of purity and ploidy are derived from few clonal events. CLONET exploits individuals’ genetic background by using the abundant germline heterozygous SNP (called informative SNPs) genotype data provided by whole genome sequence coverage to quantify the percentage of reads supporting the considered aberration. A closed-form solution relates aberrant reads with clonality status and allows propagating uncertainty due to sequencing. CLONET computes the clonality of somatic copy number changes, point mutations, and rearrangements in a coherent mathematical model enabling comparison across tumor types of the same aberration class and across different aberrations within the same tumor type. Finally, the temporal path along which the somatic aberrations originated is inferred from the composite frequencies at which they are observed to be clonal or subclonal in a single sample. CLONET allows harnessing NGS data, including whole genome, whole exome, and targeted sequencing, to determine the percentage of tumor cells harboring each mutation and to draft evolution charts.","title":"CLONET","url":"http://demichelislab.unitn.it/doku.php?id=public:clonet"},

Several CNV detection methods are available, but differences in CNV call thresholds and characteristics exist. We evaluated the relative performance of seven methods: circular binary segmentation, CNVFinder, cnvPartition, gain and loss of DNA, Nexus algorithms, PennCNV and QuantiSNP. Tested data included real and simulated Illumina HumHap 550 data from the Singapore cohort study of the risk factors for Myopia (SCORM) and simulated data from Affymetrix 6.0 and platform-independent distributions. The normalized singleton ratio (NSR) is proposed as a metric for parameter optimization before enacting full analysis. We used 10 SCORM samples for optimizing parameter settings for each method and then evaluated method performance at optimal parameters using 100 SCORM samples. The statistical power, false positive rates, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve residuals were evaluated by simulation studies. Optimal parameters, as determined by NSR and ROC curve residuals, were consistent across datasets. QuantiSNP outperformed other methods based on ROC curve residuals over most datasets.

The vast number of short reads produced by these techniques, however, pose significant computational challenges. The first step in many types of genomic analysis is the mapping of short reads to a reference genome, and several groups have developed dedicated algorithms and software packages to perform this function. As the developers of these packages optimize their algorithms with respect to various considerations, the relative merits of different software packages remain unclear. However, for scientists who generate and use NGS data for their specific research projects, an important consideration is choosing the software that is most suitable for their application.<br>RESULTS: With a view to comparing existing short read alignment software, we develop a simulation and evaluation suite, Seal, which simulates NGS runs for different configurations of various factors, including sequencing error, indels and coverage. We also develop criteria to compare the performances of software with disparate output structure (e.g. some packages return a single alignment while some return multiple possible alignments). Using these criteria, we comprehensively evaluate the performances of Bowtie, BWA, mr- and mrsFAST, Novoalign, SHRiMP and SOAPv2, with regard to accuracy and runtime.<br>CONCLUSION: We expect that the results presented here will be useful to investigators in choosing the alignment software that is most suitable for their specific research aims.

The data from single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays are now routinely used for genotyping, but they also can be utilized for copy number detection. Substantial progress has been made in array design and CNV calling algorithms and at least 10 comparison studies in humans have been published to assess them. In this review, we first survey the literature on existing microarray platforms and CNV calling algorithms. We then examine a number of CNV calling tools to evaluate their impacts using bovine high-density SNP data. Large incongruities in the results from different CNV calling tools highlight the need for standardizing array data collection, quality assessment and experimental validation. Only after careful experimental design and rigorous data filtering can the impacts of CNVs on both normal phenotypic variability and disease susceptibility be fully revealed.","title":"Comparative analysis of CNV calling algorithms: literature survey and a case study using bovine high-density SNP data","url":"http://www.mdpi.com/2076-3905/2/3/171"},

However, the accuracy of CNV detection is not sufficient and results differ depending on the detection programs used and their parameters. In this study, we evaluated five widely used CNV detection programs, Birdsuite (mainly consisting of the Birdseye and Canary modules), Birdseye (part of Birdsuite), PennCNV, CGHseg, and DNAcopy from the viewpoint of performance on the Affymetrix platform using HapMap data and other experimental data. Furthermore, we identified CNVs of 180 healthy Japanese individuals using parameters that showed the best performance in the HapMap data and investigated their characteristics.<br>RESULTS: The results indicate that Hidden Markov model-based programs PennCNV and Birdseye (part of Birdsuite), or Birdsuite show better detection performance than other programs when the high reproducibility rates of the same individuals and the low Mendelian inconsistencies are considered. Furthermore, when rates of overlap with other experimental results were taken into account, Birdsuite showed the best performance from the view point of sensitivity but was expected to include many false negatives and some false positives. The results of 180 healthy Japanese demonstrate that the ratio containing repeat sequences, not only segmental repeats but also long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) sequences both in the start and end regions of the CNVs, is higher in CNVs that are commonly detected among multiple individuals than that in randomly selected regions, and the conservation score based on primates is lower in these regions than in randomly selected regions. Similar tendencies were observed in HapMap data and other experimental data.<br>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that not only segmental repeats but also interspersed repeats, especially LINE sequences, are deeply involved in CNVs, particularly in common CNV formations.

A fast algorithm, de Bruijn graph has been successfully used for genome DNA de novo assembly; nevertheless, its performance for transcriptome assembly is unclear. In this study, we used both simulated and real RNA-Seq data, from either artificial RNA templates or human transcripts, to evaluate five de novo assemblers, ABySS, Mira, Trinity, Velvet and Oases. Of these assemblers, ABySS, Trinity, Velvet and Oases are all based on de Bruijn graph, and Mira uses an overlap graph algorithm. Various numbers of RNA short reads were selected from the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) data and human chromosome 22. A number of statistics were then calculated for the resulting contigs from each assembler. Each experiment was repeated multiple times to obtain the mean statistics and standard error estimate. Trinity had relative good performance for both ERCC and human data, but it may not consistently generate full length transcripts. ABySS was the fastest method but its assembly quality was low. Mira gave a good rate for mapping its contigs onto human chromosome 22, but its computational speed is not satisfactory. Our results suggest that transcript assembly remains a challenge problem for bioinformatics society.

These methods have been analysed regarding the performance in the identification of structurally/evolutionary related proteins, but so far there has been less focus on the objective comparison between the alignments produced by different methods.<br>RESULTS: We analysed and compared the structural alignments obtained by different methods using three sets of pairs of structurally related proteins. The first set corresponds to 355 pairs of remote homologous proteins according to the SCOP database (ASTRAL40 set). The second set was derived from the SISYPHUS database and includes 69 protein pairs (SISY set). The third set consists of 40 pairs that are challenging to align (RIPC set). The alignment of pairs of this set requires indels of considerable number and size and some of the proteins are related by circular permutations, show extensive conformational variability or include repetitions. Two standard methods (CE and DALI) were applied to align the proteins in the ASTRAL40 set. The extent of structural similarity identified by both methods is highly correlated and the alignments from the two methods agree on average in more than half of the aligned positions. CE, DALI, as well as four additional methods (FATCAT, MATRAS, Calpha-match and SHEBA) were then compared using the SISY and RIPC sets. The accuracy of the alignments was assessed by comparison to reference alignments. The alignments generated by the different methods on average match more than half of the reference alignments in the SISY set. The alignments obtained in the more challenging RIPC set tend to differ considerably and match reference alignments less successfully than the SISY set alignments.<br>CONCLUSION: The alignments produced by different methods tend to agree to a considerable extent, but the agreement is lower for the more challenging pairs. The results for the comparison to reference alignments are encouraging, but also indicate that there is still room for improvement.","title":"Comparative analysis of protein structure alignments","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17672887"},

Currently, the most popular use of RNA-Seq is to identify genes which are differentially expressed between two or more conditions. Despite the importance of Gene Set Analysis (GSA) in the interpretation of the results from RNA-Seq experiments, the limitations of GSA methods developed for microarrays in the context of RNA-Seq data are not well understood.<br>RESULTS: We provide a thorough evaluation of popular multivariate and gene-level self-contained GSA approaches on simulated and real RNA-Seq data. The multivariate approach employs multivariate non-parametric tests combined with popular normalizations for RNA-Seq data. The gene-level approach utilizes univariate tests designed for the analysis of RNA-Seq data to find gene-specific P-values and combines them into a pathway P-value using classical statistical techniques. Our results demonstrate that the Type I error rate and the power of multivariate tests depend only on the test statistics and are insensitive to the different normalizations. In general standard multivariate GSA tests detect pathways that do not have any bias in terms of pathways size, percentage of differentially expressed genes, or average gene length in a pathway. In contrast the Type I error rate and the power of gene-level GSA tests are heavily affected by the methods for combining P-values, and all aforementioned biases are present in detected pathways.<br>CONCLUSIONS: Our result emphasizes the importance of using self-contained non-parametric multivariate tests for detecting differentially expressed pathways for RNA-Seq data and warns against applying gene-level GSA tests, especially because of their high level of Type I error rates for both, simulated and real data.","title":"Comparative evaluation of gene set analysis approaches for RNA-Seq data","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25475910"},

Following the emergence of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, CNV detection methods based on the short read data have recently been developed. However, due to the relatively young age of the procedures, their performance is not fully understood. To help investigators choose suitable methods to detect CNVs, comparative studies are needed. We compared six publicly available CNV detection methods: CNV-seq, FREEC, readDepth, CNVnator, SegSeq and event-wise testing (EWT). They are evaluated both on simulated and real data with different experiment settings. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is employed to demonstrate the detection performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity, box plot is employed to compare their performances in terms of breakpoint and copy number estimation, Venn diagram is employed to show the consistency among these methods, and F-score is employed to show the overlapping quality of detected CNVs. The computational demands are also studied.

Whole transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has emerged as a genome-wide tool for identifying ASE, but suffers from mapping bias favoring reference alleles. Two categories of methods are adopted nowadays, to reduce the effect of mapping bias on ASE identification-normalizing RNA allelic ratio with the parallel genomic allelic ratio (pDNAar) and modifying reference genome to make reads carrying both alleles with the same chance to be mapped (mREF). We compared the sensitivity and specificity of both methods with simulated data, and demonstrated that the pDNAar, though ideally practical, was lower in sensitivity, because of its lower mapping rate of reads carrying nonreference (alternative) alleles, although mREF achieved higher sensitivity and specificity for its efficiency in mapping reads carrying both alleles. Application of these two methods in real sequencing data showed that mREF were able to identify more ASE loci because of its higher mapping efficiency, and able to correcting some seemly incorrect ASE loci identified by pDNAar due to the inefficiency in mapping reads carrying alternative alleles of pDNAar. Our study provides useful information for RNA sequencing data processing in the identification of ASE.","title":"Comparing computational methods for identification of allele-specific expression based on next generation sequencing data","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25183311"},

And yet, scant attention has been paid to comparative assessments of these assemblers' quality and accuracy. No commonly accepted and standardized method for comparison exists yet. Even worse, widely used metrics to compare the assembled sequences emphasize only size, poorly capturing the contig quality and accuracy. This paper addresses these concerns: it highlights common anomalies in assembly accuracy through a rigorous study of several assemblers, compared under both standard metrics (N50, coverage, contig sizes, etc.) as well as a more comprehensive metric (Feature-Response Curves, FRC) that is introduced here; FRC transparently captures the trade-offs between contigs' quality against their sizes. For this purpose, most of the publicly available major sequence assemblers--both for low-coverage long (Sanger) and high-coverage short (Illumina) reads technologies--are compared. These assemblers are applied to microbial (Escherichia coli, Brucella, Wolbachia, Staphylococcus, Helicobacter) and partial human genome sequences (Chr. Y), using sequence reads of various read-lengths, coverages, accuracies, and with and without mate-pairs. It is hoped that, based on these evaluations, computational biologists will identify innovative sequence assembly paradigms, bioinformaticists will determine promising approaches for developing \"next-generation\" assemblers, and biotechnologists will formulate more meaningful design desiderata for sequencing technology platforms. A new software tool for computing the FRC metric has been developed and is available through the AMOS open-source consortium.","title":"Comparing de novo genome assembly: the long and short of it","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21559467"},

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies produce large volumes of fragmented genome reads, which require large amounts of memory to assemble the complete genome efficiently. With recent improvements in DNA sequencing technologies, it is expected that the memory footprint required for the assembly process will increase dramatically and will emerge as a limiting factor in processing widely available NGS-generated reads. In this report, we compare current memory-efficient techniques for genome assembly with respect to quality, memory consumption and execution time. Our experiments prove that it is possible to generate draft assemblies of reasonable quality on conventional multi-purpose computers with very limited available memory by choosing suitable assembly methods. Our study reveals the minimum memory requirements for different assembly programs even when data volume exceeds memory capacity by orders of magnitude. By combining existing methodologies, we propose two general assembly strategies that can improve short-read assembly approaches and result in reduction of the memory footprint.

These advances are of particular interest to researchers studying organisms with missing or incomplete genomes, as the need for knowledge of sequence information is overcome. De novo assembly methods have gained widespread acceptance in the RNA-Seq community for organisms with no true reference genome or transcriptome. While such methods have tremendous utility, computational cost is still a significant challenge for organisms with large and complex genomes. RESULTS: In this manuscript, we present a comparison of four reference-based mapping methods for non-human primate data. We utilize TopHat2 and GSNAP for mapping to the human genome, and Bowtie2 and Stampy for mapping to the human genome and transcriptome for a total of six mapping approaches. For each of these methods, we explore mapping rates and locations, number of detected genes, correlations between computed expression values, and the utility of the resulting data for differential expression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We show that reference-based mapping methods indeed have utility in RNA-Seq analysis of mammalian data with no true reference, and the details of mapping methods should be carefully considered when doing so. Critical algorithm features include short seed sequences, the allowance of mismatches, and the allowance of gapped alignments in addition to splice junction gaps.

However, despite a proliferation of Bisulfite-seq mapping tools, no systematic comparison of their genomic coverage and quantitative accuracy has been reported. We sequenced bisulfite-converted DNA from two tissues from each of two healthy human adults and systematically compared five widely used Bisulfite-seq mapping algorithms: Bismark, BSMAP, Pash, BatMeth and BS Seeker. We evaluated their computational speed and genomic coverage and verified their percentage methylation estimates.

Fourfold variation in mapping time was found between BSMAP (fastest) and Pash (slowest). In each library, 8-12% of genomic regions covered by Bismark and Pash were not covered by BSMAP. An experiment using simulated reads confirmed that Pash has an exceptional ability to uniquely map reads in genomic regions of structural variation. Independent verification by bisulfite pyrosequencing generally confirmed the percentage methylation estimates by the mappers. Of these algorithms, Bismark provides an attractive combination of processing speed, genomic coverage and quantitative accuracy, whereas Pash offers considerably higher genomic coverage.","title":"Comparison and quantitative verification of mapping algorithms for whole-genome bisulfite sequencing","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24391148"},

Since then, an enormous amount of information about in vivo protein phosphorylation events has been collected providing a treasure trove for gaining a better understanding of the molecular processes involved in cell signaling. Yet, we still face the problem of how to achieve correct modification site localization. Here we use alternative fragmentation and different bioinformatics approaches for the identification and confident localization of phosphorylation sites. Phosphopeptide-enriched fractions were analyzed by multistage activation, collision-induced dissociation and electron transfer dissociation (ETD), yielding complementary phosphopeptide identifications. We further found that MASCOT, OMSSA and Andromeda each identified a distinct set of phosphopeptides allowing the number of site assignments to be increased. The postsearch engine SLoMo provided confident phosphorylation site localization, whereas different versions of PTM-Score integrated in MaxQuant differed in performance. Based on high-resolution ETD and higher collisional dissociation (HCD) data sets from a large synthetic peptide and phosphopeptide reference library reported by Marx et al. [Nat. Biotechnol. 2013, 31 (6), 557-564], we show that an Andromeda/PTM-Score probability of 1 is required to provide an false localization rate (FLR) of 1% for HCD data, while 0.55 is sufficient for high-resolution ETD spectra. Additional analyses of HCD data demonstrated that for phosphotyrosine peptides and phosphopeptides containing two potential phosphorylation sites, PTM-Score probability cutoff values of &lt;1 can be applied to ensure an FLR of 1%. Proper adjustment of localization probability cutoffs allowed us to significantly increase the number of confident sites with an FLR of &lt;1%.Our findings underscore the need for the systematic assessment of FLRs for different score values to report confident modification site localization.","title":"Comparison of alternative MS/MS and bioinformatics approaches for confident phosphorylation site localization","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24364495"},

Key to successful exploitation of these datasets is the ability to confidently match relatively short sequence reads to known bacterial transcripts. In the absence of reference genomes, such annotation efforts may be enhanced by assembling reads into longer contiguous sequences ('contigs'), prior to database search strategies. Since reads from homologous transcripts may derive from several species, represented at different abundance levels, it is not clear how well current assembly pipelines perform for metatranscriptomic datasets. Here we evaluate the performance of four currently employed assemblers including de novo transcriptome assemblers - Trinity and Oases; the metagenomic assembler - Metavelvet; and the recently developed metatranscriptomic assembler IDBA-MT.<br>RESULTS: We evaluated the performance of the assemblers on a previously published dataset of single-end RNA sequence reads derived from the large intestine of an inbred non-obese diabetic mouse model of type 1 diabetes. We found that Trinity performed best as judged by contigs assembled, reads assigned to contigs, and number of reads that could be annotated to a known bacterial transcript. Only 15.5% of RNA sequence reads could be annotated to a known transcript in contrast to 50.3% with Trinity assembly. Paired-end reads generated from the same mouse samples resulted in modest performance gains. A database search estimated that the assemblies are unlikely to erroneously merge multiple unrelated genes sharing a region of similarity (&lt;2% of contigs). A simulated dataset based on ten species confirmed these findings. A more complex simulated dataset based on 72 species found that greater assembly errors were introduced than is expected by sequencing quality. Through the detailed evaluation of assembly performance, the insights provided by this study will help drive the design of future metatranscriptomic analyses.<br>CONCLUSION: Assembly of metatranscriptome datasets greatly improved read annotation. Of the four assemblers evaluated, Trinity provided the best performance.

This review not only helps to identify some novel and useful features, which are not yet included in any of the databases but also highlights their current limitations and subsequently propose the reasonable solutions for future database development, which could be useful to the whole scientific community.","title":"Comparison of human cell signaling pathway databases-evolution, drawbacks and challenges","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25632107"},
{"description":"Authors: Mosen-Ansorena, D., Aransay, A.M., and Rodriguez-Ezpeleta, N.<br><br>Abstract: BACKGROUND: The detection of genomic copy number alterations (CNA) in cancer based on SNP arrays requires methods that take into account tumour specific factors such as normal cell contamination and tumour heterogeneity. A number of tools have been recently developed but their performance needs yet to be thoroughly assessed. To this aim, a comprehensive model that integrates the factors of normal cell contamination and intra-tumour heterogeneity and that can be translated to synthetic data on which to perform benchmarks is indispensable.<br>RESULTS: We propose such model and implement it in an R package called CnaGen to synthetically generate a wide range of alterations under different normal cell contamination levels. Six recently published methods for CNA and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) detection on tumour samples were assessed on this synthetic data and on a dilution series of a breast cancer cell-line: ASCAT, GAP, GenoCNA, GPHMM, MixHMM and OncoSNP. We report the recall rates in terms of normal cell contamination levels and alteration characteristics: length, copy number and LOH state, as well as the false discovery rate distribution for each copy number under different normal cell contamination levels. Assessed methods are in general better at detecting alterations with low copy number and under a little normal cell contamination levels. All methods except GPHMM, which failed to recognize the alteration pattern in the cell-line samples, provided similar results for the synthetic and cell-line sample sets. MixHMM and GenoCNA are the poorliest performing methods, while GAP generally performed better. This supports the viability of approaches other than the common hidden Markov model (HMM)-based.<br>CONCLUSIONS: We devised and implemented a comprehensive model to generate data that simulate tumoural samples genotyped using SNP arrays. The validity of the model is supported by the similarity of the results obtained with synthetic and real data. Based on these results and on the software implementation of the methods, we recommend GAP for advanced users and GPHMM for a fully driven analysis.","title":"Comparison of methods to detect copy number alterations in cancer using simulated and real genotyping data","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22870940"},

In a previous study, we established an oligonucleotide microarray platform to detect miRNA expression. Because it contained only hundreds of probes, data normalization was difficult. In this study, the microarray data for eight miRNAs extracted from inflamed rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) tissue were normalized using 15 methods and compared with the results of real-time polymerase chain reaction. It was found that the miRNA microarray data normalized by the print-tip loess method were the most consistent with results from real-time polymerase chain reaction. Moreover, the same pattern was also observed in 14 different types of rat tissue. This study compares a variety of normalization methods and will be helpful in the preprocessing of miRNA microarray data.","title":"Comparison of normalization methods with microRNA microarray","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18514480"},

A fundamental research problem in many RNA-seq studies is the identification of reliable molecular markers that show differential expression between distinct sample groups. Together with the growing popularity of RNA-seq, a number of data analysis methods and pipelines have already been developed for this task. Currently, however, there is no clear consensus about the best practices yet, which makes the choice of an appropriate method a daunting task especially for a basic user without a strong statistical or computational background. To assist the choice, we perform here a systematic comparison of eight widely used software packages and pipelines for detecting differential expression between sample groups in a practical research setting and provide general guidelines for choosing a robust pipeline. In general, our results demonstrate how the data analysis tool utilized can markedly affect the outcome of the data analysis, highlighting the importance of this choice.","title":"Comparison of software packages for detecting differential expression in RNA-seq studies","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24300110"},

Although numerous studies have compared the performance of various algorithms on exome data, there has not yet been a systematic evaluation using PCR-enriched amplicon data with a range of variant allele fractions.

{"description":"Authors: Liu, R., Loraine, A.E., and Dickerson, J.A.<br><br>Abstract: BACKGROUND: Alternative Splicing (AS) as a post-transcription regulation mechanism is an important application of RNA-seq studies in eukaryotes. A number of software and computational methods have been developed for detecting AS. Most of the methods, however, are designed and tested on animal data, such as human and mouse. Plants genes differ from those of animals in many ways, e.g., the average intron size and preferred AS types. These differences may require different computational approaches and raise questions about their effectiveness on plant data. The goal of this paper is to benchmark existing computational differential splicing (or transcription) detection methods so that biologists can choose the most suitable tools to accomplish their goals.<br>RESULTS: This study compares the eight popular public available software packages for differential splicing analysis using both simulated and real Arabidopsis thaliana RNA-seq data. All software are freely available. The study examines the effect of varying AS ratio, read depth, dispersion pattern, AS types, sample sizes and the influence of annotation. Using a real data, the study looks at the consistences between the packages and verifies a subset of the detected AS events using PCR studies.<br>CONCLUSIONS: No single method performs the best in all situations. The accuracy of annotation has a major impact on which method should be chosen for AS analysis. DEXSeq performs well in the simulated data when the AS signal is relative strong and annotation is accurate. Cufflinks achieve a better tradeoff between precision and recall and turns out to be the best one when incomplete annotation is provided. Some methods perform inconsistently for different AS types. Complex AS events that combine several simple AS events impose problems for most methods, especially for MATS. MATS stands out in the analysis of real RNA-seq data when all the AS events being evaluated are simple AS events.","title":"Comparisons of computational methods for differential alternative splicing detection using RNA-seq in plant systems","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25511303"},

RNA-seq data promise to allow identification and quantification of transcriptome at unprecedented level of resolution, accuracy and low cost. Several computational methods have been proposed to achieve such purposes. However, it is still not clear which promises are already met and which challenges are still open and require further methodological developments.<br>RESULTS: We carried out a simulation study to assess the performance of 5 widely used tools, such as: CEM, Cufflinks, iReckon, RSEM, and SLIDE. All of them have been used with default parameters. In particular, we considered the effect of the following three different scenarios: the availability of complete annotation, incomplete annotation, and no annotation at all. Moreover, comparisons were carried out using the methods in three different modes of action. In the first mode, the methods were forced to only deal with those isoforms that are present in the annotation; in the second mode, they were allowed to detect novel isoforms using the annotation as guide; in the third mode, they were operating in fully data driven way (although with the support of the alignment on the reference genome). In the latter modality, precision and recall are quite poor. On the contrary, results are better with the support of the annotation, even though it is not complete. Finally, abundance estimation error often shows a very skewed distribution. The performance strongly depends on the true real abundance of the isoforms. Lowly (and sometimes also moderately) expressed isoforms are poorly detected and estimated. In particular, lowly expressed isoforms are identified mainly if they are provided in the original annotation as potential isoforms.<br>CONCLUSIONS: Both detection and quantification of all isoforms from RNA-seq data are still hard problems and they are affected by many factors. Overall, the performance significantly changes since it depends on the modes of action and on the type of available annotation. Results obtained using complete or partial annotation are able to detect most of the expressed isoforms, even though the number of false positives is often high. Fully data driven approaches require more attention, at least for complex eucaryotic genomes. Improvements are desirable especially for isoform quantification and for isoform detection with low abundance.","title":"Computational approaches for isoform detection and estimation: good and bad news","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885830"},

{"description":"Authors: Davey, N.E., Edwards, R.J., and Shields, D.C.<br><br>Abstract: Short linear motifs (SLiMs) in proteins can act as targets for proteolytic cleavage, sites of post-translational modification, determinants of sub-cellular localization, and mediators of protein-protein interactions. Computational discovery of SLiMs involves assembling a group of proteins postulated to share a potential motif, masking out residues less likely to contain such a motif, down-weighting shared motifs arising through common evolutionary descent, and calculation of statistical probabilities allowing for the multiple testing of all possible motifs. Much of the challenge for motif discovery lies in the assembly and masking of datasets of proteins likely to share motifs, since the motifs are typically short (between 3 and 10 amino acids in length), so that potential signals can be easily swamped by the noise of stochastically recurring motifs. Focusing on disordered regions of proteins, where SLiMs are predominantly found, and masking out non-conserved residues can reduce the level of noise but more work is required to improve the quality of high-throughput experimental datasets (e.g. of physical protein interactions) as input for computational discovery.","title":"Computational identification and analysis of protein short linear motifs","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20515727"},
{"description":"Authors: Chen, Y.A., and Eschrich, S.A.<br><br>Abstract: Protein phosphorylation, one of the most ubiquitous post-translational modifications (PTM) of proteins, is known to play an essential role in cell signaling and regulation. With the increasing understanding of the complexity and redundancy of cell signaling, there is a growing recognition that targeting the entire network or system could be a necessary and advantageous strategy for treating cancer. Protein kinases, the proteins that add a phosphate group to the substrate proteins during phosphorylation events, have become one of the largest groups of 'druggable' targets in cancer therapeutics in recent years. Kinase inhibitors are being regularly used in clinics for cancer treatment. This therapeutic paradigm shift in cancer research is partly due to the generation and availability of high-dimensional proteomics data. Generation of this data, in turn, is enabled by increased use of mass-spectrometry (MS)-based or other high-throughput proteomics platforms as well as companion public databases and computational tools. This review briefly summarizes the current state and progress on phosphoproteomics identification, quantification, and platform related characteristics. We review existing database resources, computational tools, methods for phosphorylation network inference, and ultimately demonstrate the connection to therapeutics. Finally, many research opportunities exist for bioinformaticians or biostatisticians based on developments and limitations of the current and emerging technologies.","title":"Computational methods and opportunities for phosphorylation network medicine","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25530950"},

{"description":"Authors: Kristensen, D.M., Wolf, Y.I., Mushegian, A.R., and Koonin, E.V.<br><br>Abstract: Accurate inference of orthologous genes is a pre-requisite for most comparative genomics studies, and is also important for functional annotation of new genomes. Identification of orthologous gene sets typically involves phylogenetic tree analysis, heuristic algorithms based on sequence conservation, synteny analysis, or some combination of these approaches. The most direct tree-based methods typically rely on the comparison of an individual gene tree with a species tree. Once the two trees are accurately constructed, orthologs are straightforwardly identified by the definition of orthology as those homologs that are related by speciation, rather than gene duplication, at their most recent point of origin. Although ideal for the purpose of orthology identification in principle, phylogenetic trees are computationally expensive to construct for large numbers of genes and genomes, and they often contain errors, especially at large evolutionary distances. Moreover, in many organisms, in particular prokaryotes and viruses, evolution does not appear to have followed a simple 'tree-like' mode, which makes conventional tree reconciliation inapplicable. Other, heuristic methods identify probable orthologs as the closest homologous pairs or groups of genes in a set of organisms. These approaches are faster and easier to automate than tree-based methods, with efficient implementations provided by graph-theoretical algorithms enabling comparisons of thousands of genomes. Comparisons of these two approaches show that, despite conceptual differences, they produce similar sets of orthologs, especially at short evolutionary distances. Synteny also can aid in identification of orthologs. Often, tree-based, sequence similarity- and synteny-based approaches can be combined into flexible hybrid methods.","title":"Computational methods for Gene Orthology inference","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21690100"},
{"description":"Authors: Puton, T., Kozlowski, L., Tuszynska, I., Rother, K., and Bujnicki, J.M.<br><br>Abstract: Understanding the molecular mechanism of protein-RNA recognition and complex formation is a major challenge in structural biology. Unfortunately, the experimental determination of protein-RNA complexes by X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is tedious and difficult. Alternatively, protein-RNA interactions can be predicted by computational methods. Although less accurate than experimental observations, computational predictions can be sufficiently accurate to prompt functional hypotheses and guide experiments, e.g. to identify individual amino acid or nucleotide residues. In this article we review 10 methods for predicting protein-RNA interactions, seven of which predict RNA-binding sites from protein sequences and three from structures. We also developed a meta-predictor that uses the output of top three sequence-based primary predictors to calculate a consensus prediction, which outperforms all the primary predictors. In order to fully cover the software for predicting protein-RNA interactions, we also describe five methods for protein-RNA docking. The article highlights the strengths and shortcomings of existing methods for the prediction of protein-RNA interactions and provides suggestions for their further development.","title":"Computational methods for prediction of protein-RNA interactions","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22019768"},

{"description":"Author: Caflisch, A.<br><br>Abstract: In amyloid fibrils, beta-strand conformations of polypeptide chains, or segments thereof, are perpendicular to the fibril axis, but knowledge of their three dimensional structure at atomic level of detail is scarce. Two types of computational approaches have been developed recently for investigating the aggregation propensity of peptides and proteins and identifying the segments most prone to form fibrils (hot spots). The physicochemical properties of the natural amino acids (e.g. beta-propensity, hydrophobicity, aromatic content and charge) have been used to derive phenomenological models able to predict changes in aggregation rate upon mutation, as well as absolute rates and hot spots. Applications of these models to entire proteomes have provided evidence that intrinsically disordered proteins are less amyloidogenic than globular proteins. In the second type of approach, amyloidogenic polypeptides have been decomposed into overlapping segments, and atomistic simulations of three or more copies of each segment have been performed to obtain insights into aggregation propensity and structural details of the ordered aggregates (e.g. turn regions).","title":"Computational models for the prediction of polypeptide aggregation propensity","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16880001"},

Signaling defects associated with protein phosphorylation are linked to many diseases, particularly cancer. Characterizing protein kinases and their substrates enhances our ability to understand and treat such diseases and broadens our knowledge of signaling networks in general. While most or all protein kinases have been identified in well-studied eukaryotes, the sites that they phosphorylate have been only partially elucidated. Experimental methods for identifying phosphorylation sites are resource intensive, so the ability to computationally predict potential sites has considerable value.<br>RESULTS: Many computational techniques for phosphorylation site prediction have been proposed, most of which are available on the web. These techniques differ in several ways, including the machine learning technique used; the amount of sequence information used; whether or not structural information is used in addition to sequence information; whether predictions are made for specific kinases or for kinases in general; and sources of training and testing data. This review summarizes, categorizes and compares the available methods for phosphorylation site prediction, and provides an overview of the challenges that are faced when designing predictors and how they have been addressed.

{"description":"Authors: Morrow, J.K., and Zhang, S.<br><br>Abstract: Most biological processes involve multiple proteins interacting with each other. It has been recently discovered that certain residues in these protein-protein interactions, which are called hot spots, contribute more significantly to binding affinity than others. Hot spot residues have unique and diverse energetic properties that make them challenging yet important targets in the modulation of protein-protein complexes. Design of therapeutic agents that interact with hot spot residues has proven to be a valid methodology in disrupting unwanted protein-protein interactions. Using biological methods to determine which residues are hot spots can be costly and time consuming. Recent advances in computational approaches to predict hot spots have incorporated a myriad of features, and have shown increasing predictive successes.

{"description":"Authors: Edwards, R.J., and Palopoli, N.<br><br>Abstract: Short Linear Motifs (SLiMs) are functional protein microdomains that typically mediate interactions between a short linear region in one protein and a globular domain in another. SLiMs usually occur in structurally disordered regions and mediate low affinity interactions. Most SLiMs are 3-15 amino acids in length and have 2-5 defined positions, making them highly likely to occur by chance and extremely difficult to identify. Nevertheless, our knowledge of SLiMs and capacity to predict them from protein sequence data using computational methods has advanced dramatically over the past decade. By considering the biological, structural, and evolutionary context of SLiM occurrences, it is possible to differentiate functional instances from chance matches in many cases and to identify new regions of proteins that have the features consistent with a SLiM-mediated interaction. Their simplicity also makes SLiMs evolutionarily labile and prone to independent origins on different sequence backgrounds through convergent evolution, which can be exploited for predicting novel SLiMs in proteins that share a function or interaction partner. In this review, we explore our current knowledge of SLiMs and how it can be applied to the task of predicting them computationally from protein sequences. Rather than focusing on specific SLiM prediction tools, we provide an overview of the methods available and concentrate on principles that should continue to be paramount even in the light of future developments. We consider the relative merits of using regular expressions or profiles for SLiM discovery and discuss the main considerations for both predicting new instances of known SLiMs, and de novo prediction of novel SLiMs. In particular, we highlight the importance of correctly modelling evolutionary relationships and the probability of false positive predictions.","title":"Computational prediction of short linear motifs from protein sequences","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25555723"},

To aid this goal, a large number of software tools of variable sophistication have been implemented, enabling the design of synthetic genes for sequence optimization based on rationally defined properties. The first generation of tools dealt predominantly with singular objectives such as codon usage optimization and unique restriction site incorporation. Recent years have seen the emergence of sequence design tools that aim to evolve sequences toward combinations of objectives. The design of optimal protein-coding sequences adhering to multiple objectives is computationally hard, and most tools rely on heuristics to sample the vast sequence design space. In this review, we study some of the algorithmic issues behind gene optimization and the approaches that different tools have adopted to redesign genes and optimize desired coding features.

Many programs have been designed to correct these errors, most of them targeting the data produced by the dominant technology of Illumina. We present a thorough comparison of these programs. Both HiSeq and MiSeq types of Illumina data are analyzed, and correcting performance is evaluated as the gain in depth and breadth of coverage, as given by correct reads and k-mers. Time and memory requirements, scalability and parallelism are considered as well. Practical guidelines are provided for the effective use of these tools.

Of particular interest is the discovery of differentially expressed genes across different conditions (e.g., tissues, perturbations) while optionally adjusting for other systematic factors that affect the data-collection process. There are a number of subtle yet crucial aspects of these analyses, such as read counting, appropriate treatment of biological variability, quality control checks and appropriate setup of statistical modeling. Several variations have been presented in the literature, and there is a need for guidance on current best practices. This protocol presents a state-of-the-art computational and statistical RNA-seq differential expression analysis workflow largely based on the free open-source R language and Bioconductor software and, in particular, on two widely used tools, DESeq and edgeR.

{"description":"Authors: Lange, E., Tautenhahn, R., Neumann, S., and Gropl, C.<br><br>Abstract: BACKGROUND: Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has become a prominent tool for the analysis of complex proteomics and metabolomics samples. In many applications multiple LC-MS measurements need to be compared, e. g. to improve reliability or to combine results from different samples in a statistical comparative analysis. As in all physical experiments, LC-MS data are affected by uncertainties, and variability of retention time is encountered in all data sets. It is therefore necessary to estimate and correct the underlying distortions of the retention time axis to search for corresponding compounds in different samples. To this end, a variety of so-called LC-MS map alignment algorithms have been developed during the last four years. Most of these approaches are well documented, but they are usually evaluated on very specific samples only. So far, no publication has been assessing different alignment algorithms using a standard LC-MS sample along with commonly used quality criteria.<br>RESULTS: We propose two LC-MS proteomics as well as two LC-MS metabolomics data sets that represent typical alignment scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a new quality measure for the evaluation of LC-MS alignment algorithms. Using the four data sets to compare six freely available alignment algorithms proposed for the alignment of metabolomics and proteomics LC-MS measurements, we found significant differences with respect to alignment quality, running time, and usability in general.<br>CONCLUSION: The multitude of available alignment methods necessitates the generation of standard data sets and quality measures that allow users as well as developers to benchmark and compare their map alignment tools on a fair basis. Our study represents a first step in this direction. Currently, the installation and evaluation of the \"correct\" parameter settings can be quite a time-consuming task, and the success of a particular method is still highly dependent on the experience of the user. Therefore, we propose to continue and extend this type of study to a community-wide competition. All data as well as our evaluation scripts are available at http://msbi.ipb-halle.de/msbi/caap.","title":"Critical assessment of alignment procedures for LC-MS proteomics and metabolomics measurements","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18793413"},
{"description":"Authors: Yang, T., Deng, H.W., and Niu, T.<br><br>Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coalescent simulation is pivotal for understanding population evolutionary models and demographic histories, as well as for developing novel analytical methods for genetic association studies for DNA sequence data. A plethora of coalescent simulators are developed, but selecting the most appropriate program remains challenging.<br>RESULTS: We extensively compared performances of five widely used coalescent simulators - Hudson's ms, msHOT, MaCS, Simcoal2, and fastsimcoal, to provide a practical guide considering three crucial factors, 1) speed, 2) scalability and 3) recombination hotspot position and intensity accuracy. Although ms represents a popular standard coalescent simulator, it lacks the ability to simulate sequences with recombination hotspots. An extended program msHOT has compensated for the deficiency of ms by incorporating recombination hotspots and gene conversion events at arbitrarily chosen locations and intensities, but remains limited in simulating long stretches of DNA sequences. Simcoal2, based on a discrete generation-by-generation approach, could simulate more complex demographic scenarios, but runs comparatively slow. MaCS and fastsimcoal, both built on fast, modified sequential Markov coalescent algorithms to approximate standard coalescent, are much more efficient whilst keeping salient features of msHOT and Simcoal2, respectively. Our simulations demonstrate that they are more advantageous over other programs for a spectrum of evolutionary models. To validate recombination hotspots, LDhat 2.2 rhomap package, sequenceLDhot and Haploview were compared for hotspot detection, and sequenceLDhot exhibited the best performance based on both real and simulated data.<br>CONCLUSIONS: While ms remains an excellent choice for general coalescent simulations of DNA sequences, MaCS and fastsimcoal are much more scalable and flexible in simulating a variety of demographic events under different recombination hotspot models. Furthermore, sequenceLDhot appears to give the most optimal performance in detecting and validating cross-over hotspots.","title":"Critical assessment of coalescent simulators in modeling recombination hotspots in genomic sequences","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24387001"},
{"description":"Authors: Ahrne, E., Molzahn, L., Glatter, T., and Schmidt, A.<br><br>Abstract: There is a great interest in reliable ways to obtain absolute protein abundances at a proteome-wide scale. To this end, label-free LC-MS/MS quantification methods have been proposed where all identified proteins are assigned an estimated abundance. Several variants of this quantification approach have been presented, based on either the number of spectral counts per protein or MS1 peak intensities. Equipped with several datasets representing real biological environments, containing a high number of accurately quantified reference proteins, we evaluate five popular low-cost and easily implemented quantification methods (Absolute Protein Expression, Exponentially Modified Protein Abundance Index, Intensity-Based Absolute Quantification Index, Top3, and MeanInt). Our results demonstrate considerably improved abundance estimates upon implementing accurately quantified reference proteins; that is, using spiked in stable isotope labeled standard peptides or a standard protein mix, to generate a properly calibrated quantification model. We show that only the Top3 method is directly proportional to protein abundance over the full quantification range and is the preferred method in the absence of reference protein measurements. Additionally, we demonstrate that spectral count based quantification methods are associated with higher errors than MS1 peak intensity based methods. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of miscleaved, modified, and shared peptides as well as protein size and the number of employed reference proteins on quantification accuracy.","title":"Critical assessment of proteome-wide label-free absolute abundance estimation strategies","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23794183"},

Current stage technology allows the acquisition of profiles for a moderate number of genes (50 to a few thousand), and this number continues to grow. The use of appropriate normalization algorithms for qPCR-based data is therefore a highly important aspect of the data preprocessing pipeline.<br>RESULTS: We present and evaluate two data-driven normalization methods that directly correct for technical variation and represent robust alternatives to standard housekeeping gene-based approaches. We evaluated the performance of these methods against a single gene housekeeping gene method and our results suggest that quantile normalization performs best. These methods are implemented in freely-available software as an R package qpcrNorm distributed through the Bioconductor project.<br>CONCLUSION: The utility of the approaches that we describe can be demonstrated most clearly in situations where standard housekeeping genes are regulated by some experimental condition. For large qPCR-based data sets, our approaches represent robust, data-driven strategies for normalization.","title":"Data-driven normalization strategies for high-throughput quantitative RT-PCR","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19374774"},

Accurate variation and genotype-phenotype databases are critical in our ability to make sense of the vast amount of information that MPS generates. The purpose of this review is to summarize the state of the art of variation and genotype-phenotype databases, how they can be used, and opportunities to improve these resources. Our working assumption is that the objective of the clinical genomicist is to identify highly penetrant variants that could explain existing disease or predict disease risk for individual patients or research participants. We have detailed how current databases contribute to this goal providing frequency data, literature reviews and predictions of causation for individual variants. For variant annotation, databases vary greatly in their ease of use, the use of standard mutation nomenclature, the comprehensiveness of the variant cataloging and the degree of expert opinion. Ultimately, we need a dynamic and comprehensive reference database of medically important variants that is easily cross referenced to exome and genome sequence data and allows for an accumulation of expert opinion.","title":"Databases of genomic variation and phenotypes: existing resources and future needs","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23962721"},

The huge volume of reads, along with short read length, high coverage, and sequencing errors, poses a great challenge to de novo genome assembly. However, the paired-end information provides a new solution to these problems. In this paper, we review and compare some current assembly tools, including Newbler, CAP3, Velvet, SOAPdenovo, AllPaths, Abyss, IDBA, PE-Assembly, and Telescoper. In general, we compare the seed extension and graph-based methods that use the overlap/lapout/consensus approach and the de Bruijn graph approach for assembly. At the end of the paper, we summarize these methods and discuss the future directions of genome assembly.","title":"De novo assembly methods for next generation sequencing data","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&arnumber=6616523"},
{"description":"Authors: Lun, A.T., and Smyth, G.K.<br><br>Abstract: A common aim in ChIP-seq experiments is to identify changes in protein binding patterns between conditions, i.e. differential binding. A number of peak- and window-based strategies have been developed to detect differential binding when the regions of interest are not known in advance. However, careful consideration of error control is needed when applying these methods. Peak-based approaches use the same data set to define peaks and to detect differential binding. Done improperly, this can result in loss of type I error control. For window-based methods, controlling the false discovery rate over all detected windows does not guarantee control across all detected regions. Misinterpreting the former as the latter can result in unexpected liberalness. Here, several solutions are presented to maintain error control for these de novo counting strategies. For peak-based methods, peak calling should be performed on pooled libraries prior to the statistical analysis. For window-based methods, a hybrid approach using Simes' method is proposed to maintain control of the false discovery rate across regions. More generally, the relative advantages of peak- and window-based strategies are explored using a range of simulated and real data sets. Implementations of both strategies also compare favourably to existing programs for differential binding analyses.","title":"De novo detection of differentially bound regions for ChIP-seq data using peaks and windows: controlling error rates correctly","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24852250"},

Both random and systematic errors can show a specific occurrence profile for each of the six prominent sequencing platforms surveyed here: 454 pyrosequencing, Complete Genomics DNA nanoball sequencing, Illumina sequencing by synthesis, Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing, Pacific Biosciences single-molecule real-time sequencing and Oxford Nanopore sequencing. There is a large variety of programs available for error removal in sequencing read data, which differ in the error models and statistical techniques they use, the features of the data they analyse, the parameters they determine from them and the data structures and algorithms they use. We highlight the assumptions they make and for which data types these hold, providing guidance which tools to consider for benchmarking with regard to the data properties. While no benchmarking results are included here, such specific benchmarks would greatly inform tool choices and future software development. The development of stand-alone error correctors, as well as single nucleotide variant and haplotype callers, could also benefit from using more of the knowledge about error profiles and from (re)combining ideas from the existing approaches presented here.","title":"Denoising DNA deep sequencing data-high-throughput sequencing errors and their correction","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26026159"},

Although a variety of methods exist for analysis of the established alternative ChIP microarray (ChIP-chip), few approaches have been described for processing ChIP-seq data. To fill this gap, we propose an analysis pipeline specifically designed to detect protein-binding positions with high accuracy. Using previously reported data sets for three transcription factors, we illustrate methods for improving tag alignment and correcting for background signals. We compare the sensitivity and spatial precision of three peak detection algorithms with published methods, demonstrating gains in spatial precision when an asymmetric distribution of tags on positive and negative strands is considered. We also analyze the relationship between the depth of sequencing and characteristics of the detected binding positions, and provide a method for estimating the sequencing depth necessary for a desired coverage of protein binding sites.","title":"Design and analysis of ChIP-seq experiments for DNA-binding proteins","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19029915"},

Analysis of variations in guanine-cytosine content, gene coverage, sequencing error rate and insert size allowed identification of decreased reproducibility across sites. Moreover, commonly used methods for normalization (cqn, EDASeq, RUV2, sva, PEER) varied in their ability to remove these systematic biases, depending on sample complexity and initial data quality. Normalization methods that combine data from genes across sites are strongly recommended to identify and remove site-specific effects and can substantially improve RNA-seq studies.","title":"Detecting and correcting systematic variation in large-scale RNA sequencing data","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25150837"},
{"description":"Authors: Wang, M., and Lin, S.<br><br>Abstract: In recent years, a myriad of new statistical methods have been proposed for detecting associations of rare single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) with common diseases. These methods can be generally classified as 'collapsing' or 'haplotyping' based. The former is the predominant class, composed of most of the rare variant association methods proposed to date. However, recent works have suggested that haplotyping-based methods may offer advantages and can even be more powerful than collapsing methods in certain situations. In this article, we review and compare collapsing- versus haplotyping-based methods/software in terms of both power and type I error. For collapsing methods, we consider three approaches: Combined Multivariate and Collapsing, Sequence Kernel Association Test and Family-Based Association Test (FBAT): the first two are population based and are among the most popular; the last test is family based, a modification from the popular FBAT to accommodate rare SNVs. For haplotyping-based methods, we include Logistic Bayesian Lasso (LBL) for population data and family-based LBL (famLBL) for family (trio) data. These two methods are selected, as they can be used to test association for specific rare and common haplotypes. Our results show that haplotype methods can be more powerful than collapsing methods if there are interacting SNVs leading to larger haplotype effects. Even if only common SNVs are genotyped, haplotype methods can still detect specific rare haplotypes that tag rare causal SNVs. As expected, family-based methods are robust, whereas population-based methods are susceptible, to population substructure. However, the population-based haplotype approach appears to have smaller inflation of type I error than its collapsing counterparts.","title":"Detecting associations of rare variants with common diseases: collapsing or haplotyping?","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25596401"},

{"description":"Authors: Williamson, V., Kim, A., Xie, B., McMichael, G.O., Gao, Y., and Vladimirov, V.<br><br>Abstract: Deep sequencing has become a popular tool for novel miRNA detection but its data must be viewed carefully as the state of the field is still undeveloped. Using three different programs, miRDeep (v1, 2), miRanalyzer and DSAP, we have analyzed seven data sets (six biological and one simulated) to provide a critical evaluation of the programs performance. We selected these software based on their popularity and overall approach toward the detection of novel and known miRNAs using deep-sequencing data. The program comparisons suggest that, despite differing stringency levels they all identify a similar set of known and novel predictions. Comparisons between the first and second version of miRDeep suggest that the stringency level of each of these programs may, in fact, be a result of the algorithm used to map the reads to the target. Different stringency levels are likely to affect the number of possible novel candidates for functional verification, causing undue strain on resources and time. With that in mind, we propose that an intersection across multiple programs be taken, especially if considering novel candidates that will be targeted for additional analysis. Using this approach, we identify and performed initial validation of 12 novel predictions in our in-house data with real-time PCR, six of which have been previously unreported.","title":"Detecting miRNAs in deep-sequencing data: a software performance comparison and evaluation","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23334922"},
{"description":"Authors: Corley, M., Solem, A., Qu, K., Chang, H.Y., and Laederach, A.<br><br>Abstract: Ribonucleic acid (RNA) secondary structure prediction continues to be a significant challenge, in particular when attempting to model sequences with less rigidly defined structures, such as messenger and non-coding RNAs. Crucial to interpreting RNA structures as they pertain to individual phenotypes is the ability to detect RNAs with large structural disparities caused by a single nucleotide variant (SNV) or riboSNitches. A recently published human genome-wide parallel analysis of RNA structure (PARS) study identified a large number of riboSNitches as well as non-riboSNitches, providing an unprecedented set of RNA sequences against which to benchmark structure prediction algorithms. Here we evaluate 11 different RNA folding algorithms' riboSNitch prediction performance on these data. We find that recent algorithms designed specifically to predict the effects of SNVs on RNA structure, in particular remuRNA, RNAsnp and SNPfold, perform best on the most rigorously validated subsets of the benchmark data. In addition, our benchmark indicates that general structure prediction algorithms (e.g. RNAfold and RNAstructure) have overall better performance if base pairing probabilities are considered rather than minimum free energy calculations. Although overall aggregate algorithmic performance on the full set of riboSNitches is relatively low, significant improvement is possible if the highest confidence predictions are evaluated independently.","title":"Detecting riboSNitches with RNA folding algorithms: a genome-wide benchmark","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25618847"},
{"description":"Authors: Wang, Q., Jia, P., Li, F., Chen, H., Ji, H., Hucks, D., Dahlman, K.B., Pao, W., and Zhao, Z.<br><br>Abstract: BACKGROUND: Driven by high throughput next generation sequencing technologies and the pressing need to decipher cancer genomes, computational approaches for detecting somatic single nucleotide variants (sSNVs) have undergone dramatic improvements during the past 2 years. The recently developed tools typically compare a tumor sample directly with a matched normal sample at each variant locus in order to increase the accuracy of sSNV calling. These programs also address the detection of sSNVs at low allele frequencies, allowing for the study of tumor heterogeneity, cancer subclones, and mutation evolution in cancer development.<br>METHODS: We used whole genome sequencing (Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx platform) of a melanoma sample and matched blood, whole exome sequencing (Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform) of 18 lung tumor-normal pairs and seven lung cancer cell lines to evaluate six tools for sSNV detection: EBCall, JointSNVMix, MuTect, SomaticSniper, Strelka, and VarScan 2, with a focus on MuTect and VarScan 2, two widely used publicly available software tools. Default/suggested parameters were used to run these tools. The missense sSNVs detected in these samples were validated through PCR and direct sequencing of genomic DNA from the samples. We also simulated 10 tumor-normal pairs to explore the ability of these programs to detect low allelic-frequency sSNVs.<br>RESULTS: Out of the 237 sSNVs successfully validated in our cancer samples, VarScan 2 and MuTect detected the most of any tools (that is, 204 and 192, respectively). MuTect identified 11 more low-coverage validated sSNVs than VarScan 2, but missed 11 more sSNVs with alternate alleles in normal samples than VarScan 2. When examining the false calls of each tool using 169 invalidated sSNVs, we observed &gt;63% false calls detected in the lung cancer cell lines had alternate alleles in normal samples. Additionally, from our simulation data, VarScan 2 identified more sSNVs than other tools, while MuTect characterized most low allelic-fraction sSNVs.<br>CONCLUSIONS: Our study explored the typical false-positive and false-negative detections that arise from the use of sSNV-calling tools. Our results suggest that despite recent progress, these tools have significant room for improvement, especially in the discrimination of low coverage/allelic-frequency sSNVs and sSNVs with alternate alleles in normal samples.","title":"Detecting somatic point mutations in cancer genome sequencing data: a comparison of mutation callers","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24112718"},

This protocol describes in detail how to use TopHat and Cufflinks to perform such analyses. It also covers several accessory tools and utilities that aid in managing data, including CummeRbund, a tool for visualizing RNA-seq analysis results. Although the procedure assumes basic informatics skills, these tools assume little to no background with RNA-seq analysis and are meant for novices and experts alike.

To date, these interaction maps have typically been generated under a single condition, even though biological systems undergo differential change that is dependent on environment, tissue type, disease state, development or speciation. Several recent interaction mapping studies have demonstrated the power of differential analysis for elucidating fundamental biological responses, revealing that the architecture of an interactome can be massively re-wired during a cellular or adaptive response. Here, we review the technological developments and experimental designs that have enabled differential network mapping at very large scales and highlight biological insight that has been derived from this type of analysis. We argue that differential network mapping, which allows for the interrogation of previously unexplored interaction spaces, will become a standard mode of network analysis in the future, just as differential gene expression and protein phosphorylation studies are already pervasive in genomic and proteomic analysis.","title":"Differential network biology","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22252388"},

{"description":"Authors: Ellis, T., Adie, T., and Baldwin, G.S.<br><br>Abstract: The assembly of DNA from small fragments into large constructs has seen significant recent development, becoming a pivotal technology in the ability to implement the vision of synthetic biology. As the cost of whole gene synthesis is decreasing, whole genome synthesis at the other end of the spectrum has expanded our horizons to the prospect of fully engineered synthetic cells. However, the recently proven ability to synthesise genome-scale DNA is at odds with our ability to rationally engineer biological devices, which lags significantly behind. Most work in synthetic biology takes place on an intermediate scale with the combinatorial construction of networks and metabolic pathways from registries of modular biopart components. Implementation for rapid prototyping of engineered biological circuits requires quick and reliable DNA assembly according to specific architectures. It is apparent that DNA assembly is now a limiting technology in advancing synthetic biology. Current techniques employ standardised restriction enzyme assembly protocols such as BioBricks, BglBricks and Golden Gate methods. Alternatively, sequence-independent overlap techniques, such as In-Fusion, SLIC and Gibson isothermal assembly are becoming popular for larger assemblies, and in vivo DNA assembly in yeast and bacillus appears adept for chromosome fabrication. It is important to consider how the use of different technologies may impact the outcome of a construction, since the assembly technique can direct the architecture and diversity of systems that can be made. This review provides a critical examination of recent DNA assembly strategies and considers how this important facilitating aspect of synthetic biology may proceed in the future.","title":"DNA assembly for synthetic biology: from parts to pathways and beyond","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21246151"},

{"description":"Authors: Collier, G., and Ortiz, V.<br><br>Abstract: Allosteric regulation of protein function is key in controlling cellular processes so its underlying mechanisms are of primary concern to research in areas spanning protein engineering and drug design. However, due to the complex nature of allosteric mechanisms, a clear and predictive understanding of the relationship between protein structure and allosteric function remains elusive. Well established experimental approaches are available to offer a limited degree of characterization of mechanical properties within proteins, but the analytical capabilities of computational methods are evolving rapidly in their ability to accurately define the subtle and concerted structural dynamics that comprise allostery. This review includes a brief overview of allostery in proteins and an exploration of relevant experimental methods. An explanation of the transition from experimental toward computational methods for allostery is discussed, followed by a review of existing and emerging methods.","title":"Emerging computational approaches for the study of protein allostery","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23933229"},

{"description":"Authors: Rudy, J., and Valafar, F.<br><br>Abstract: BACKGROUND: Simultaneous measurement of gene expression on a genomic scale can be accomplished using microarray technology or by sequencing based methods. Researchers who perform high throughput gene expression assays often deposit their data in public databases, but heterogeneity of measurement platforms leads to challenges for the combination and comparison of data sets. Researchers wishing to perform cross platform normalization face two major obstacles. First, a choice must be made about which method or methods to employ. Nine are currently available, and no rigorous comparison exists. Second, software for the selected method must be obtained and incorporated into a data analysis workflow.<br>RESULTS: Using two publicly available cross-platform testing data sets, cross-platform normalization methods are compared based on inter-platform concordance and on the consistency of gene lists obtained with transformed data. Scatter and ROC-like plots are produced and new statistics based on those plots are introduced to measure the effectiveness of each method. Bootstrapping is employed to obtain distributions for those statistics. The consistency of platform effects across studies is explored theoretically and with respect to the testing data sets.<br>CONCLUSIONS: Our comparisons indicate that four methods, DWD, EB, GQ, and XPN, are generally effective, while the remaining methods do not adequately correct for platform effects. Of the four successful methods, XPN generally shows the highest inter-platform concordance when treatment groups are equally sized, while DWD is most robust to differently sized treatment groups and consistently shows the smallest loss in gene detection. We provide an R package, CONOR, capable of performing the nine cross-platform normalization methods considered. The package can be downloaded at http://alborz.sdsu.edu/conor and is available from CRAN.","title":"Empirical comparison of cross-platform normalization methods for gene expression data","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22151536"},

We introduce two new empirical validation data sets and test the available viral population assembly software. Two intra-host viral population 'quasispecies' samples (type-1 human immunodeficiency and hepatitis C virus) were Sanger-sequenced, and plasmid clone mixtures at controlled proportions were shotgun-sequenced using Roche's 454 sequencing platform. The performance of different assemblers was compared in terms of phylogenetic clustering and recombination with the Sanger clones. Phylogenetic clustering showed that all assemblers captured a proportion of the most divergent lineages, but none were able to provide a high precision/recall tradeoff. Estimated variant frequencies mildly correlated with the original. Given the limitations of currently available algorithms identified by our empirical validation, the development and exploitation of additional data sets is needed, in order to establish an efficient framework for viral population reconstruction using NGS.","title":"Empirical validation of viral quasispecies assembly algorithms: state-of-the-art and challenges","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24089188"},

However, to unleash its full potential, refinements in bioinformatic approaches for data analysis are still needed. In this context, sequence databases selection represents a major challenge. This work assessed the impact of different databases in metaproteomic investigations by using a mock microbial mixture including nine diverse bacterial and eukaryotic species, which was subjected to shotgun metaproteomic analysis. Then, both the microbial mixture and the single microorganisms were subjected to next generation sequencing to obtain experimental metagenomic- and genomic-derived databases, which were used along with public databases (namely, NCBI, UniProtKB/SwissProt and UniProtKB/TrEMBL, parsed at different taxonomic levels) to analyze the metaproteomic dataset. First, a quantitative comparison in terms of number and overlap of peptide identifications was carried out among all databases. As a result, only 35% of peptides were common to all database classes; moreover, genus/species-specific databases provided up to 17% more identifications compared to databases with generic taxonomy, while the metagenomic database enabled a slight increment in respect to public databases. Then, database behavior in terms of false discovery rate and peptide degeneracy was critically evaluated. Public databases with generic taxonomy exhibited a markedly different trend compared to the counterparts. Finally, the reliability of taxonomic attribution according to the lowest common ancestor approach (using MEGAN and Unipept software) was assessed. The level of misassignments varied among the different databases, and specific thresholds based on the number of taxon-specific peptides were established to minimize false positives. This study confirms that database selection has a significant impact in metaproteomics, and provides critical indications for improving depth and reliability of metaproteomic results. Specifically, the use of iterative searches and of suitable filters for taxonomic assignments is proposed with the aim of increasing coverage and trustworthiness of metaproteomic data.","title":"Evaluating the impact of different sequence databases on metaproteome analysis: insights from a lab-assembled microbial mixture","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24349410"},

Gene clustering analysis is found useful for discovering groups of correlated genes potentially co-regulated or associated to the disease or conditions under investigation. Many clustering methods including hierarchical clustering, K-means, PAM, SOM, mixture model-based clustering and tight clustering have been widely used in the literature. Yet no comprehensive comparative study has been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods.<br>RESULTS: In this paper, six gene clustering methods are evaluated by simulated data from a hierarchical log-normal model with various degrees of perturbation as well as four real datasets. A weighted Rand index is proposed for measuring similarity of two clustering results with possible scattered genes (i.e. a set of noise genes not being clustered). Performance of the methods in the real data is assessed by a predictive accuracy analysis through verified gene annotations. Our results show that tight clustering and model-based clustering consistently outperform other clustering methods both in simulated and real data while hierarchical clustering and SOM perform among the worst. Our analysis provides deep insight to the complicated gene clustering problem of expression profile and serves as a practical guideline for routine microarray cluster analysis.","title":"Evaluation and comparison of gene clustering methods in microarray analysis","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16882653"},

The growing popularity of ChIP-seq spurred the development of many different analytical programs (at last count, we noted 31 open source methods), each with some purported advantage.

{"description":"Authors: Langille, M.G., Hsiao, W.W., and Brinkman, F.S.<br><br>Abstract: BACKGROUND: Genomic islands (GIs) are clusters of genes in prokaryotic genomes of probable horizontal origin. GIs are disproportionately associated with microbial adaptations of medical or environmental interest. Recently, multiple programs for automated detection of GIs have been developed that utilize sequence composition characteristics, such as G+C ratio and dinucleotide bias. To robustly evaluate the accuracy of such methods, we propose that a dataset of GIs be constructed using criteria that are independent of sequence composition-based analysis approaches.<br>RESULTS: We developed a comparative genomics approach (IslandPick) that identifies both very probable islands and non-island regions. The approach involves 1) flexible, automated selection of comparative genomes for each query genome, using a distance function that picks appropriate genomes for identification of GIs, 2) identification of regions unique to the query genome, compared with the chosen genomes (positive dataset) and 3) identification of regions conserved across all genomes (negative dataset). Using our constructed datasets, we investigated the accuracy of several sequence composition-based GI prediction tools.<br>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that AlienHunter has the highest recall, but the lowest measured precision, while SIGI-HMM is the most precise method. SIGI-HMM and IslandPath/DIMOB have comparable overall highest accuracy. Our comparative genomics approach, IslandPick, was the most accurate, compared with a curated list of GIs, indicating that we have constructed suitable datasets. This represents the first evaluation, using diverse and, independent datasets that were not artificially constructed, of the accuracy of several sequence composition-based GI predictors.

However, so far systematic evaluation of normalization methods on microRNA sequencing data is lacking. We comprehensively evaluate seven commonly used normalization methods including global normalization, Lowess normalization, Trimmed Mean Method (TMM), quantile normalization, scaling normalization, variance stabilization, and invariant method. We assess these methods on two individual experimental data sets with the empirical statistical metrics of mean square error (MSE) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) statistic. Additionally, we evaluate the methods with results from quantitative PCR validation. Our results consistently show that Lowess normalization and quantile normalization perform the best, whereas TMM, a method applied to the RNA-Sequencing normalization, performs the worst. The poor performance of TMM normalization is further evidenced by abnormal results from the test of differential expression (DE) of microRNA-Seq data. Comparing with the models used for DE, the choice of normalization method is the primary factor that affects the results of DE. In summary, Lowess normalization and quantile normalization are recommended for normalizing microRNA-Seq data, whereas the TMM method should be used with caution.","title":"Evaluation of normalization methods in mammalian microRNA-Seq data","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22532701"},

In this study, we selected six recently published methods (DISPHOS, NetPhosK, PPSP, KinasePhos, Scansite and PredPhospho) to evaluate their performance. First, we compiled three testing datasets containing experimentally verified phosphorylation sites for mammalian, Arabidopsis and rice proteins. Then, we present the prediction performance of the tested methods on these three independent datasets. Rather than quantitatively ranking the performance of these methods, we focused on providing an understanding of the overall performance of the predictors. Based on this evaluation, we found the following results: i) current phosphorylation site predictors are not effective for practical use and there is substantial need to improve phosphorylation site prediction; ii) current predictors perform poorly when used to predict phosphorylation sites in plant phosphoproteins, suggesting that a rice-specific predictor will be required to obtain confident computational annotation of phosphorylation sites in rice proteomics research; and iii) the tested predictors are complementary to some extent, implying that establishment of a meta-server might be a promising approach to developing an improved prediction system.","title":"Evaluation of protein phosphorylation site predictors","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19508198"},

{"description":"Authors: Li, X., Li, Y., Cheng, T., Liu, Z., and Wang, R.<br><br>Abstract: Many molecular docking programs are available nowadays, and thus it is of great practical value to evaluate and compare their performance. We have conducted an extensive evaluation of four popular commercial molecular docking programs, including Glide, GOLD, LigandFit, and Surflex. Our test set consists of 195 protein-ligand complexes with high-resolution crystal structures (resolution &lt;or=2.5 A) and reliable binding data [dissociation constant (K(d)) or inhibition constant (K(i))], which are selected from the PDBbind database with an emphasis on diversity. The top-ranked solutions produced by these programs are compared to the native ligand binding poses observed in crystal structures. Glide and GOLD demonstrate better accuracy than the other two on the entire test set. Their results are also less sensitive to the starting structures for docking. Comparison of the results produced by these programs at three different computation levels reveal that their accuracy are not always proportional to CPU cost as one may expect. The binding scores of the top-ranked solutions produced by these programs are in low to moderate correlations with experimentally measured binding data. Further analyses on the outcomes of these programs on three suites of subsets of protein-ligand complexes indicate that these programs are less capable to handle really flexible ligands and relatively flat binding sites, and they have different preferences to hydrophilic/hydrophobic binding sites. Our evaluation can help other researchers to make reasonable choices among available molecular docking programs.

Powerful methods exist for CNV detection in whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, but such data are costly to obtain. Many disease causal CNVs span or are found in genome coding regions (exons), which makes CNV detection using whole exome sequencing (WES) data attractive. If reliably validated against WGS-based CNVs, exome-derived CNVs have potential applications in a clinical setting. Several algorithms have been developed to exploit exome data for CNV detection and comparisons made to find the most suitable methods for particular data samples. The results are not consistent across studies. Here, we review some of the exome CNV detection methods based on depth of coverage profiles and examine their performance to identify problems contributing to discrepancies in published results. We also present a streamlined strategy that uses a single metric, the likelihood ratio, to compare exome methods, and we demonstrated its utility using the VarScan 2 and eXome Hidden Markov Model (XHMM) programs using paired normal and tumour exome data from chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients. We use array-based somatic CNV (SCNV) calls as a reference standard to compute prevalence-independent statistics, such as sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratio, for validation of the exome-derived SCNVs. We also account for factors known to influence the performance of exome read depth methods, such as CNV size and frequency, while comparing our findings with published results.","title":"Exome sequence read depth methods for identifying copy number changes","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25169955"},

The Affymetrix Exon 1.0 ST array is a relatively new type of array, which has the capability to assess expression at the individual exon level.

As the ability to measure molecules in high-throughput ways has improved over the past decade, it is logical that such data might be useful for enabling drug repositioning through computational methods. Many computational predictions for new indications have been borne out in cellular model systems, though extensive animal model and clinical trial-based validation are still pending. In this review, we show that computational methods for drug repositioning can be classified in two axes: drug based, where discovery initiates from the chemical perspective, or disease based, where discovery initiates from the clinical perspective of disease or its pathology. Newer algorithms for computational drug repositioning will likely span these two axes, will take advantage of newer types of molecular measurements, and will certainly play a role in reducing the global burden of disease.","title":"Exploiting drug-disease relationships for computational drug repositioning","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21690101"},

By sequence complementarity, miRNAs have been estimated to regulate certain mRNA transcripts. Although it was once thought to be simple and straightforward to find plant miRNA targets, this viewpoint is being challenged by genetic and biochemical studies. In this review, we summarize recent progress in plant miRNA target recognition mechanisms, principles of target prediction, and introduce current experimental and computational tools for plant miRNA target prediction. At the end, we also present our thinking on the outlook for future directions in the development of plant miRNA target finding methods.","title":"Finding microRNA targets in plants: current status and perspectives","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23200136"},

{"description":"Authors: Cham Mead, J.A., Bianco, L., and Bessant, C.<br><br>Abstract: Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) is a technique for quantifying specific proteins using triple quadrupole MS. Proteins are digested into peptides and fed into MS following HPLC separation. The stream of ionized peptides is filtered by m/z ratio so only specific peptide targets enter the collision cell, where they are fragmented into product ions. A specific product ion is then filtered from the cell and its intensity measured. By spiking an isotopically labeled version of each target peptide into a sample, both native and surrogate peptides enter MS, pass the filters and transition into product ions in tandem; thus the quantity of the native peptide may be calculated by examining the relative intensities of the native and surrogate signals. The choice of precursor-to-product ion transitions is critical for SRM, but predicting the best candidates is challenging and time-consuming.

{"description":"Authors: Prakash, T., and Taylor, T.D.<br><br>Abstract: Metagenomic sequencing provides a unique opportunity to explore earth's limitless environments harboring scores of yet unknown and mostly unculturable microbes and other organisms. Functional analysis of the metagenomic data plays a central role in projects aiming to explore the most essential questions in microbiology, namely 'In a given environment, among the microbes present, what are they doing, and how are they doing it?' Toward this goal, several large-scale metagenomic projects have recently been conducted or are currently underway. Functional analysis of metagenomic data mainly suffers from the vast amount of data generated in these projects. The shear amount of data requires much computational time and storage space. These problems are compounded by other factors potentially affecting the functional analysis, including, sample preparation, sequencing method and average genome size of the metagenomic samples. In addition, the read-lengths generated during sequencing influence sequence assembly, gene prediction and subsequently the functional analysis. The level of confidence for functional predictions increases with increasing read-length. Usually, the most reliable functional annotations for metagenomic sequences are achieved using homology-based approaches against publicly available reference sequence databases. Here, we present an overview of the current state of functional analysis of metagenomic sequence data, bottlenecks frequently encountered and possible solutions in light of currently available resources and tools. Finally, we provide some examples of applications from recent metagenomic studies which have been successfully conducted in spite of the known difficulties.","title":"Functional assignment of metagenomic data: challenges and applications","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22772835"},

Cheaper and faster sequencing technologies make it easy to generate very high coverage of bacterial genomes, but these advances mean that DNA preparation costs can exceed the cost of sequencing for small genomes. The need to contain costs often results in the creation of only a single sequencing library, which in turn introduces new challenges for genome assembly methods.<br>RESULTS: We evaluated the ability of multiple genome assembly programs to assemble bacterial genomes from a single, deep-coverage library. For our comparison, we chose bacterial species spanning a wide range of GC content and measured the contiguity and accuracy of the resulting assemblies. We compared the assemblies produced by this very high-coverage, one-library strategy to the best assemblies created by two-library sequencing, and we found that remarkably good bacterial assemblies are possible with just one library. We also measured the effect of read length and depth of coverage on assembly quality and determined the values that provide the best results with current algorithms.<br>CONTACT: salzberg@jhu.edu SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","title":"GAGE-B: an evaluation of genome assemblers for bacterial organisms","url":"http://ccb.jhu.edu/gage_b/"},

The lowest-cost technology can generate deep coverage of most species, including mammals, in just a few days. The sequence data generated by one of these projects consist of millions or billions of short DNA sequences (reads) that range from 50 to 150 nt in length. These sequences must then be assembled de novo before most genome analyses can begin. Unfortunately, genome assembly remains a very difficult problem, made more difficult by shorter reads and unreliable long-range linking information. In this study, we evaluated several of the leading de novo assembly algorithms on four different short-read data sets, all generated by Illumina sequencers. Our results describe the relative performance of the different assemblers as well as other significant differences in assembly difficulty that appear to be inherent in the genomes themselves. Three overarching conclusions are apparent: first, that data quality, rather than the assembler itself, has a dramatic effect on the quality of an assembled genome; second, that the degree of contiguity of an assembly varies enormously among different assemblers and different genomes; and third, that the correctness of an assembly also varies widely and is not well correlated with statistics on contiguity. To enable others to replicate our results, all of our data and methods are freely available, as are all assemblers used in this study.","title":"GAGE: A critical evaluation of genome assemblies and assembly algorithms","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22147368"},

The most viable current approach to this problem consists of determining whether sets of genes are connected by some common theme, e.g. genes from the same pathway are overrepresented among those whose differential expression in response to a perturbation is most pronounced. There are many approaches to this problem, and the results they produce show a fair amount of dispersion, but they all fall within a common framework consisting of a few basic components. We critically review these components, suggest best practices for carrying out each step, and propose a voting method for meeting the challenge of assessing different methods on a large number of experimental data sets in the absence of a gold standard.","title":"Gene set enrichment analysis: performance evaluation and usage guidelines","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21900207"},

{"description":"Authors: Kehr, B., Trappe, K., Holtgrewe, M., and Reinert, K.<br><br>Abstract: BACKGROUND: Recent advances in rapid, low-cost sequencing have opened up the opportunity to study complete genome sequences. The computational approach of multiple genome alignment allows investigation of evolutionarily related genomes in an integrated fashion, providing a basis for downstream analyses such as rearrangement studies and phylogenetic inference.Graphs have proven to be a powerful tool for coping with the complexity of genome-scale sequence alignments. The potential of graphs to intuitively represent all aspects of genome alignments led to the development of graph-based approaches for genome alignment. These approaches construct a graph from a set of local alignments, and derive a genome alignment through identification and removal of graph substructures that indicate errors in the alignment.<br>RESULTS: We compare the structures of commonly used graphs in terms of their abilities to represent alignment information. We describe how the graphs can be transformed into each other, and identify and classify graph substructures common to one or more graphs. Based on previous approaches, we compile a list of modifications that remove these substructures.<br>CONCLUSION: We show that crucial pieces of alignment information, associated with inversions and duplications, are not visible in the structure of all graphs. If we neglect vertex or edge labels, the graphs differ in their information content. Still, many ideas are shared among all graph-based approaches. Based on these findings, we outline a conceptual framework for graph-based genome alignment that can assist in the development of future genome alignment tools.","title":"Genome alignment with graph data structures: a comparison","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24712884"},

Aberrant glycosylation has been associated with many illnesses such as hereditary and chronic diseases like cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and immunological disorders. Emerging mass spectrometry (MS) technologies that enable the high-throughput identification of glycoproteins and glycans have accelerated the analysis and made possible the creation of dynamic and expanding databases. Although glycosylation-related databases have been established by many laboratories and institutions, they are not yet widely known in the community. Our study reviews 15 different publicly available databases and identifies their key elements so that users can identify the most applicable platform for their analytical needs. These databases include biological information on the experimentally identified glycans and glycopeptides from various cells and organisms such as human, rat, mouse, fly and zebrafish. The features of these databases - 7 for glycoproteomic data, 6 for glycomic data, and 2 for glycan binding proteins are summarized including the enrichment techniques that are used for glycoproteome and glycan identification. Furthermore databases such as Unipep, GlycoFly, GlycoFish recently established by our group are introduced. The unique features of each database, such as the analytical methods used and bioinformatical tools available are summarized. This information will be a valuable resource for the glycobiology community as it presents the analytical methods and glycosylation related databases together in one compendium. It will also represent a step towards the desired long term goal of integrating the different databases of glycosylation in order to characterize and categorize glycoproteins and glycans better for biomedical research.","title":"Glycoproteomic and glycomic databases","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725457"},

However, genomic data are being generated faster than they could be meaningfully analyzed, leaving a large scope for developing novel compression algorithms that could directly facilitate data analysis beyond data transfer and storage. In this article, we categorize and provide a comprehensive review of the existing compression methods specialized for genomic data and present experimental results on compression ratio, memory usage, time for compression and decompression.

{"description":"Authors: Ni, J., Yan, Q., and Yu, Y.<br><br>Abstract: Metagenomic studies have dramatically expanded our knowledge of the microbial world. Furthermore, the amount of sample for sequencing has significantly increased with the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies. However, fully capturing all DNA sequences carried by every microorganism in the environment is still impossible. Therefore, estimating a reasonable and practical amount for sequencing to achieve the objectives is particularly necessary. In the present study, we introduce a novel method for estimating the required minimum amount for metagenomic sequencing for a given goal. We also calculated the genomic proportion of each operational taxonomic unit and the detection efficiency of a specific gene (we have used SSU rRNA gene as an example) based on a given amount for random metagenomic sequencing. The reasonable and practical estimated amount for sequencing in metagenomic studies will provide good reference information when applying high-throughput sequencing for a given goal.","title":"How much metagenomic sequencing is enough to achieve a given goal?","url":"http://doi.org/10.1038/srep01968"},

The complete variant detection and characterization workflow of the HugeSeq pipeline is depicted below. The pipeline consists of a modular framework on which common algorithms are implemented. It is comprised of three phases: 1) a mapping phase that prepares, aligns and formats reads; 2) a sorting phase that combines and sort reads for parallel processing of variant calling; and 3) a reduction phase that calls and annotates the different variants (SNPs, Indels and SVs). HugeSeq is based on a MapReduce approach and runs in a parallel computational environment, making it highly efficient and scalable.","title":"HugeSeq","url":"http://hugeseq.hugolam.com/"},

{"description":"Authors: Pavlopoulou, A., Spandidos, D.A., and Michalopoulos, I.<br><br>Abstract: Cancer is one of the four major non-communicable diseases (NCD), responsible for ~14.6% of all human deaths. Currently, there are &gt;100 different known types of cancer and &gt;500 genes involved in cancer. Ongoing research efforts have been focused on cancer etiology and therapy. As a result, there is an exponential growth of cancer-associated data from diverse resources, such as scientific publications, genome-wide association studies, gene expression experiments, gene-gene or protein-protein interaction data, enzymatic assays, epigenomics, immunomics and cytogenetics, stored in relevant repositories. These data are complex and heterogeneous, ranging from unprocessed, unstructured data in the form of raw sequences and polymorphisms to well-annotated, structured data. Consequently, the storage, mining, retrieval and analysis of these data in an efficient and meaningful manner pose a major challenge to biomedical investigators. In the current review, we present the central, publicly accessible databases that contain data pertinent to cancer, the resources available for delivering and analyzing information from these databases, as well as databases dedicated to specific types of cancer. Examples for this wealth of cancer-related information and bioinformatic tools have also been provided.","title":"Human cancer databases (review)","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25369839"},

However, computational prediction of copy number variants (CNVs) from exome sequence data is a challenging task. Whilst numerous programs are available, they have different sensitivities, and have low sensitivity to detect smaller CNVs (1-4 exons). Additionally, exonic CNV discovery using standard aCGH has limitations due to the low probe density over exonic regions. The goal of our study was to develop a protocol to detect exonic CNVs (including shorter CNVs that cover 1-4 exons), combining computational prediction algorithms and a high-resolution custom CGH array.<br>RESULTS: We used six published CNV prediction programs (ExomeCNV, CONTRA, ExomeCopy, ExomeDepth, CoNIFER, XHMM) and an in-house modification to ExomeCopy and ExomeDepth (ExCopyDepth) for computational CNV prediction on 30 exomes from the 1000 genomes project and 9 exomes from primary immunodeficiency patients. CNV predictions were tested using a custom CGH array designed to capture all exons (exaCGH). After this validation, we next evaluated the computational prediction of shorter CNVs. ExomeCopy and the in-house modified algorithm, ExCopyDepth, showed the highest capability in detecting shorter CNVs. Finally, the performance of each computational program was assessed by calculating the sensitivity and false positive rate.<br>CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we assessed the ability of 6 computational programs to predict CNVs, focussing on short (1-4 exon) CNVs. We also tested these predictions using a custom array targeting exons. Based on these results, we propose a protocol to identify and confirm shorter exonic CNVs combining computational prediction algorithms and custom aCGH experiments.","title":"Identification of copy number variants from exome sequence data","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25102989"},

{"description":"Authors: Li, B., Liu, D.J., and Leal, S.M.<br><br>Abstract: Although genome-wide association studies have been successful in detecting associations with common variants, there is currently an increasing interest in identifying low-frequency and rare variants associated with complex traits. Next-generation sequencing technologies make it feasible to survey the full spectrum of genetic variation in coding regions or the entire genome. The association analysis for rare variants is challenging, and traditional methods are ineffective, however, due to the low frequency of rare variants, coupled with allelic heterogeneity. Recently a battery of new statistical methods has been proposed for identifying rare variants associated with complex traits. These methods test for associations by aggregating multiple rare variants across a gene or a genomic region or among a group of variants in the genome. In this unit, we describe key concepts for rare variant association for complex traits, survey some of the recent methods, discuss their statistical power under various scenarios, and provide practical guidance on analyzing next-generation sequencing data for identifying rare variants associated with complex traits.","title":"Identifying rare variants associated with complex traits via sequencing","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23853079"},

{"description":"Authors: Pradervand, S., Weber, J., Thomas, J., Bueno, M., Wirapati, P., Lefort, K., Dotto, G.P., and Harshman, K.<br><br>Abstract: Profiling miRNA levels in cells with miRNA microarrays is becoming a widely used technique. Although normalization methods for mRNA gene expression arrays are well established, miRNA array normalization has so far not been investigated in detail. In this study we investigate the impact of normalization on data generated with the Agilent miRNA array platform. We have developed a method to select nonchanging miRNAs (invariants) and use them to compute linear regression normalization coefficients or variance stabilizing normalization (VSN) parameters. We compared the invariants normalization to normalization by scaling, quantile, and VSN with default parameters as well as to no normalization using samples with strong differential expression of miRNAs (heart-brain comparison) and samples where only a few miRNAs are affected (by p53 overexpression in squamous carcinoma cells versus control). All normalization methods performed better than no normalization. Normalization procedures based on the set of invariants and quantile were the most robust over all experimental conditions tested. Our method of invariant selection and normalization is not limited to Agilent miRNA arrays and can be applied to other data sets including those from one color miRNA microarray platforms, focused gene expression arrays, and gene expression analysis using quantitative PCR.","title":"Impact of normalization on miRNA microarray expression profiling","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19176604"},

We present an extensive evaluation of the impact of sequencing depth on identification of enriched regions for key histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K36me3, H3K27me3 and H3K9me2/me3) using deep-sequenced datasets in human and fly. We propose to define sufficient sequencing depth as the number of reads at which detected enrichment regions increase &lt;1% for an additional million reads. Although the required depth depends on the nature of the mark and the state of the cell in each experiment, we observe that sufficient depth is often reached at &lt;20 million reads for fly. For human, there are no clear saturation points for the examined datasets, but our analysis suggests 40-50 million reads as a practical minimum for most marks. We also devise a mathematical model to estimate the sufficient depth and total genomic coverage of a mark. Lastly, we find that the five algorithms tested do not agree well for broad enrichment profiles, especially at lower depths. Our findings suggest that sufficient sequencing depth and an appropriate peak-calling algorithm are essential for ensuring robustness of conclusions derived from ChIP-seq data.","title":"Impact of sequencing depth in ChIP-seq experiments","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598259"},

{"description":"Authors: Smith, R., Ventura, D., and Prince, J.T.<br><br>Abstract: Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry is widely used for comparative replicate sample analysis in proteomics, lipidomics and metabolomics. Before statistical comparison, registration must be established to match corresponding analytes from run to run. Alignment, the most popular correspondence approach, consists of constructing a function that warps the content of runs to most closely match a given reference sample. To date, dozens of correspondence algorithms have been proposed, creating a daunting challenge for practitioners in algorithm selection. Yet, existing reviews have highlighted only a few approaches. In this review, we describe 50 correspondence algorithms to facilitate practical algorithm selection. We elucidate the motivation for correspondence and analyze the limitations of current approaches, which include prohibitive runtimes, numerous user parameters, model limitations and the need for reference samples. We suggest and describe a paradigm shift for overcoming current correspondence limitations by building on known liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry behavior.","title":"LC-MS alignment in theory and practice: a comprehensive algorithmic review","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24273217"},

{"description":"Authors: Alkan, C., Sajjadian, S., and Eichler, E.E.<br><br>Abstract: High-throughput sequencing technologies promise to transform the fields of genetics and comparative biology by delivering tens of thousands of genomes in the near future. Although it is feasible to construct de novo genome assemblies in a few months, there has been relatively little attention to what is lost by sole application of short sequence reads. We compared the recent de novo assemblies using the short oligonucleotide analysis package (SOAP), generated from the genomes of a Han Chinese individual and a Yoruban individual, to experimentally validated genomic features. We found that de novo assemblies were 16.2% shorter than the reference genome and that 420.2 megabase pairs of common repeats and 99.1% of validated duplicated sequences were missing from the genome. Consequently, over 2,377 coding exons were completely missing. We conclude that high-quality sequencing approaches must be considered in conjunction with high-throughput sequencing for comparative genomics analyses and studies of genome evolution.","title":"Limitations of next-generation genome sequence assembly","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21102452"},

They have been found to confer a novel layer of genetic regulation in a wide range of biological processes. Computational miRNA target prediction remains one of the key means used to decipher the role of miRNAs in development and disease. Here we introduce the basic idea behind the experimental identification of miRNA targets and present some of the most widely used computational miRNA target identification programs. The review includes an assessment of the prediction quality of these programs and their combinations.<br>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","title":"Lost in translation: an assessment and perspective for computational microRNA target identification","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19789267"},

{"description":"Author: Alexandrov, T.<br><br>Abstract: Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) imaging mass spectrometry, also called MALDI-imaging, is a label-free bioanalytical technique used for spatially-resolved chemical analysis of a sample. Usually, MALDI-imaging is exploited for analysis of a specially prepared tissue section thaw mounted onto glass slide. A tremendous development of the MALDI-imaging technique has been observed during the last decade. Currently, it is one of the most promising innovative measurement techniques in biochemistry and a powerful and versatile tool for spatially-resolved chemical analysis of diverse sample types ranging from biological and plant tissues to bio and polymer thin films. In this paper, we outline computational methods for analyzing MALDI-imaging data with the emphasis on multivariate statistical methods, discuss their pros and cons, and give recommendations on their application. The methods of unsupervised data mining as well as supervised classification methods for biomarker discovery are elucidated. We also present a high-throughput computational pipeline for interpretation of MALDI-imaging data using spatial segmentation. Finally, we discuss current challenges associated with the statistical analysis of MALDI-imaging data.","title":"MALDI imaging mass spectrometry: statistical data analysis and current computational challenges","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23176142"},

The developed pipeline first compares enrichment-based sequencing data of multiple samples to the public NCBI Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)-archive (dbSNP) in order to screen the obtained non-duplicate, uniquely mappable sequence reads for SNPs. Only SNP loci with an adequately coverage and allele frequency are retained and the effect of sequencing errors is further reduced by comparing the chance of a sequencing error with the chance of detecting genuine SNPs. For each single SNP locus, the Hardy-Weinberg theorem is then applied to evaluate whether the observed frequency of samples featured by a biallelic event is lower than randomly expected.","title":"MAM-pipeline","url":"http://www.biobix.be/MAM/"},

Furthermore, as in the case of sequence alignment, MaWISh allows flexibility in adjusting parameters to quantify underlying evolutionary relationships.","title":"MaWISh","url":"http://compbio.case.edu/koyuturk/software/mawish/"},

Such reads can be aligned accurately with the Smith-Waterman algorithm but it can take hours and days to map millions of reads even for bacteria genomes. A GPU program called MaxSSmap was introduced with the aim of achieving comparable accuracy to Smith-Waterman but with faster runtimes. Similar to most programs MaxSSmap identifies a local region of the genome followed by exact alignment. Instead of using hash tables or Burrows-Wheeler in the first part, MaxSSmap calculates maximum scoring subsequence score between the read and disjoint fragments of the genome in parallel on a GPU and selects the highest scoring fragment for exact alignment.","title":"MaxSSmap","url":"http://cs.njit.edu/usman/MaxSSmap/"},

{"description":"Authors: Chang, L.C., Lin, H.M., Sibille, E., and Tseng, G.C.<br><br>Abstract: BACKGROUND: As high-throughput genomic technologies become accurate and affordable, an increasing number of data sets have been accumulated in the public domain and genomic information integration and meta-analysis have become routine in biomedical research. In this paper, we focus on microarray meta-analysis, where multiple microarray studies with relevant biological hypotheses are combined in order to improve candidate marker detection. Many methods have been developed and applied in the literature, but their performance and properties have only been minimally investigated. There is currently no clear conclusion or guideline as to the proper choice of a meta-analysis method given an application; the decision essentially requires both statistical and biological considerations.<br>RESULTS: We performed 12 microarray meta-analysis methods for combining multiple simulated expression profiles, and such methods can be categorized for different hypothesis setting purposes: (1) HS(A): DE genes with non-zero effect sizes in all studies, (2) HS(B): DE genes with non-zero effect sizes in one or more studies and (3) HS(r): DE gene with non-zero effect in \"majority\" of studies. We then performed a comprehensive comparative analysis through six large-scale real applications using four quantitative statistical evaluation criteria: detection capability, biological association, stability and robustness. We elucidated hypothesis settings behind the methods and further apply multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) and an entropy measure to characterize the meta-analysis methods and data structure, respectively.<br>CONCLUSIONS: The aggregated results from the simulation study categorized the 12 methods into three hypothesis settings (HS(A), HS(B), and HS(r)). Evaluation in real data and results from MDS and entropy analyses provided an insightful and practical guideline to the choice of the most suitable method in a given application. All source files for simulation and real data are available on the author's publication website.","title":"Meta-analysis methods for combining multiple expression profiles: comparisons, statistical characterization and an application guideline","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24359104"},

Multivariate phenotypes are frequently encountered in genetic association studies. The purpose of analyzing multivariate phenotypes usually includes discovery of novel genetic variants of pleiotropy effects, that is, affecting multiple phenotypes, and the ultimate goal of uncovering the underlying genetic mechanism. In recent years, there have been new method development and application of existing statistical methods to such phenotypes. In this paper, we provide a review of the available methods for analyzing association between a single marker and a multivariate phenotype consisting of the same type of components (e.g., all continuous or all categorical) or different types of components (e.g., some are continuous and others are categorical). We also reviewed causal inference methods designed to test whether the detected association with the multivariate phenotype is truly pleiotropy or the genetic marker exerts its effects on some phenotypes through affecting the others.","title":"Methods for Analyzing Multivariate Phenotypes in Genetic Association Studies","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24748889"},

Identifying the location of the binding site is therefore a vital first step in this process, restricting the search space for SBDD or virtual screening studies. The detection and characterisation of functional sites on proteins has increasingly become an area of interest. Structural genomics projects are increasingly yielding protein structures with unknown functions and binding sites. Binding site prediction was pioneered by pocket detection, since the binding site is often found in the largest pocket. More recent methods involve phylogenetic analysis, identifying structural similarity with proteins of known function and identifying regions on the protein surface with a potential for high binding affinity. Binding site prediction has been used in several SBDD projects and has been incorporated into several docking tools. We discuss different methods of ligand binding site prediction, their strengths and weaknesses, and how they have been used in SBDD.","title":"Methods for the prediction of protein-ligand binding sites for structure-based drug design and virtual ligand screening","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17073692"},

To understand the functional consequences of DNA methylation on phenotypic plasticity, a genome-wide analysis should be embraced. This in turn requires a technique that balances accuracy, genome coverage, resolution and cost, yet is low in DNA input in order to minimize the drain on precious samples. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (MeDIP-seq) fulfils these criteria, combining MeDIP with massively parallel DNA sequencing. Here we report an improved protocol using 100-fold less genomic DNA than that commonly used. We show comparable results for specificity (&gt;97%) and enrichment (&gt;100-fold) over a wide range of DNA concentrations (5,000-50 ng) and demonstrate the utility of the protocol for the generation of methylomes from rare bone marrow cells using 160-300 ng of starting DNA.

At the same time, the statistical methodology for microarray analysis has progressed from simple visual assessments of results to a weekly deluge of papers that describe purportedly novel algorithms for analysing changes in gene expression. Although the many procedures that are available might be bewildering to biologists who wish to apply them, statistical geneticists are recognizing commonalities among the different methods. Many are special cases of more general models, and points of consensus are emerging about the general approaches that warrant use and elaboration.","title":"Microarray data analysis: from disarray to consolidation and consensus","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16369572"},
{"description":"Authors: Song, S., and Black, M.A.<br><br>Abstract: BACKGROUND: The analysis of gene sets has become a popular topic in recent times, with researchers attempting to improve the interpretability and reproducibility of their microarray analyses through the inclusion of supplementary biological information. While a number of options for gene set analysis exist, no consensus has yet been reached regarding which methodology performs best, and under what conditions. The goal of this work was to examine the performance characteristics of a collection of existing gene set analysis methods, on both simulated and real microarray data sets. Of particular interest was the potential utility gained through the incorporation of inter-gene correlation into the analysis process.<br>RESULTS: Each of six gene set analysis methods was applied to both simulated and publicly available microarray data sets. Overall, the various methodologies were all found to be better at detecting gene sets that moved from non-active (i.e., genes not expressed) to active states (or vice versa), rather than those that simply changed their level of activity. Methods which incorporate correlation structures were found to provide increased ability to detect altered gene sets in some settings.<br>CONCLUSION: Based on the results obtained through the analysis of simulated data, it is clear that the performance of gene set analysis methods is strongly influenced by the features of the data set in question, and that methods which incorporate correlation structures into the analysis process tend to achieve better performance, relative to methods which rely on univariate test statistics.","title":"Microarray-based gene set analysis: a comparison of current methods","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19038052"},

{"description":"A ranking algorithm based on random walks to propagate information of known miRNAs to candidates. The miRank method has the following properties. First, it does not require information of genome annotation. This is particularly important because many sequenced genomes have not been well annotated, and their closely related species are yet to be sequenced. Thus, a large number of false positive candidates with hairpinned secondary structures cannot be filtered out with genome annotation or by phylogenetic conservation. miRank can be applied to such newly sequenced genomes with little annotation. Second, it does not rely on cross-species conservation so that it can identify species-specific miRNAs. Third, miRank is able to accommodate a small number of known miRNAs while enjoys a high-prediction accuracy. Hence, miRank is a useful tool for many species including most viruses that have a very few reported miRNAs.","title":"MiRank"},

Molecular docking is a computer simulation procedure to predict the conformation of a receptor-ligand complex. Each docking program makes use of one or more specific search algorithms, which are the methods used to predict the possible conformations of a binary complex.

{"description":"Author: Ertl, P.<br><br>Abstract: A molecule editor, that is program for input and editing of molecules, is an indispensable part of every cheminformatics or molecular processing system. This review focuses on a special type of molecule editors, namely those that are used for molecule structure input on the web. Scientific computing is now moving more and more in the direction of web services and cloud computing, with servers scattered all around the Internet. Thus a web browser has become the universal scientific user interface, and a tool to edit molecules directly within the web browser is essential.The review covers a history of web-based structure input, starting with simple text entry boxes and early molecule editors based on clickable maps, before moving to the current situation dominated by Java applets. One typical example - the popular JME Molecule Editor - will be described in more detail. Modern Ajax server-side molecule editors are also presented. And finally, the possible future direction of web-based molecule editing, based on technologies like JavaScript and Flash, is discussed.","title":"Molecular structure input on the web","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20298528"},

Although genetic epidemiological studies typically contain data collected on multiple traits which themselves are often correlated, most analyses have been performed on single traits. Here, I review several methods that have been developed to perform multiple trait analysis. These methods range from traditional multivariate models for systems of equations to recently developed graphical approaches based on network theory. The application of network theory to genetics is termed systems genetics and has the potential to address long-standing questions in genetics about complex processes such as coordinate regulation, homeostasis, and pleiotropy.","title":"Moving toward System Genetics through Multiple Trait Analysis in Genome-Wide Association Studies","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22303408"},

{"description":"Authors: Barash, D., and Churkin, A.<br><br>Abstract: Programs for RNA mutational analysis that are structure-based and rely on secondary structure prediction have been developed and expanded in the past several years. They can be used for a variety of purposes, such as in suggesting point mutations that will alter RNA virus replication or translation initiation, investigating the effect of deleterious and compensatory mutations in allosteric ribozymes and riboswitches, computing an optimal path of mutations to get from one ribozyme fold to another, or analyzing regulatory RNA sequences by their mutational profile. This review describes three different freeware programs (RNAMute, RDMAS and RNAmutants) that have been developed for such purposes. RNAMute and RDMAS in principle perform energy minimization prediction by available software such as RNAfold from the Vienna RNA package or Zuker's Mfold, while RNAmutants provides an efficient method using essential ingredients from energy minimization prediction. Both RNAMute in its extended version that uses RNAsubopt from the Vienna RNA package and the RNAmutants software are able to predict multiple-point mutations using developed methodologies, while RDMAS is currently restricted to single-point mutations. The strength of RNAMute in its extended version is the ability to predict a small number of point mutations in an accurate manner. RNAmutants is well fit for large scale simulations involving the calculation of all k-mutants, where k can be a large integer number, of a given RNA sequence.","title":"Mutational analysis in RNAs: comparing programs for RNA deleterious mutation prediction","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21422070"},

{"description":"Authors: Jia, P., and Zhao, Z.<br><br>Abstract: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have rapidly become a powerful tool in genetic studies of complex diseases and traits. Traditionally, single marker-based tests have been used prevalently in GWAS and have uncovered tens of thousands of disease-associated SNPs. Network-assisted analysis (NAA) of GWAS data is an emerging area in which network-related approaches are developed and utilized to perform advanced analyses of GWAS data in order to study various human diseases or traits. Progress has been made in both methodology development and applications of NAA in GWAS data, and it has already been demonstrated that NAA results may enhance our interpretation and prioritization of candidate genes and markers. Inspired by the strong interest in and high demand for advanced GWAS data analysis, in this review article, we discuss the methodologies and strategies that have been reported for the NAA of GWAS data. Many NAA approaches search for subnetworks and assess the combined effects of multiple genes participating in the resultant subnetworks through a gene set analysis. With no restriction to pre-defined canonical pathways, NAA has the advantage of defining subnetworks with the guidance of the GWAS data under investigation. In addition, some NAA methods prioritize genes from GWAS data based on their interconnections in the reference network. Here, we summarize NAA applications to various diseases and discuss the available options and potential caveats related to their practical usage. Additionally, we provide perspectives regarding this rapidly growing research area.","title":"Network.assisted analysis to prioritize GWAS results: principles, methods and perspectives","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24122152"},

{"description":"Author: Karchin, R.<br><br>Abstract: Computational biology has the opportunity to play an important role in the identification of functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) discovered in large-scale genotyping studies, ultimately yielding new drug targets and biomarkers. The medical genetics and molecular biology communities are increasingly turning to computational biology methods to prioritize interesting SNPs found in linkage and association studies. Many such methods are now available through web interfaces, but the interested user is confronted with an array of predictive results that are often in disagreement with each other. Many tools today produce results that are difficult to understand without bioinformatics expertise, are biased towards non-synonymous SNPs, and do not necessarily reflect up-to-date versions of their source bioinformatics resources, such as public SNP repositories. Here, I assess the utility of the current generation of webservers; and suggest improvements for the next generation of webservers to better deliver value to medical geneticists and molecular biologists.","title":"Next generation tools for the annotation of human SNPs","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19181721"},

{"description":"Authors: Henson, J., Tischler, G., and Ning, Z.<br><br>Abstract: The next-generation sequencing (NGS) revolution has drastically reduced time and cost requirements for sequencing of large genomes, and also qualitatively changed the problem of assembly. This article reviews the state of the art in de novo genome assembly, paying particular attention to mammalian-sized genomes. The strengths and weaknesses of the main sequencing platforms are highlighted, leading to a discussion of assembly and the new challenges associated with NGS data. Current approaches to assembly are outlined and the various software packages available are introduced and compared. The question of whether quality assemblies can be produced using short-read NGS data alone, or whether it must be combined with more expensive sequencing techniques, is considered. Prospects for future assemblers and tests of assembly performance are also discussed.","title":"Next-generation sequencing and large genome assemblies","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22676195"},

Existing sequencing technologies are more mature and accessible than the methodologies that are available for individual researchers to move, store, analyse and present data in a fashion that is transparent and reproducible. Here we discuss currently pressing issues with analysis, interpretation, reproducibility and accessibility of these data, and we present promising solutions and venture into potential future developments.","title":"Next-generation sequencing data interpretation: enhancing reproducibility and accessibility","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22898652"},

Recent advances in sequencing technologies and assembly algorithms have facilitated the reconstruction of the entire transcriptome by deep RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), even without a reference genome. However, transcriptome assembly from billions of RNA-seq reads, which are often very short, poses a significant informatics challenge. This Review summarizes the recent developments in transcriptome assembly approaches - reference-based, de novo and combined strategies - along with some perspectives on transcriptome assembly in the near future.","title":"Next-generation transcriptome assembly","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21897427"},

As a benchmark we have used reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. The results show that reads per kilobase per million (RPKM) and trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) normalization systematically leads to biased gene expression estimates. Biological scaling normalization (BSN), designed to handle differences in total expression, showed improved accuracy compared to the two other methods in estimating transcript level dynamics.

{"description":"Authors: Nagarajan, R., Ahmad, S., and Gromiha, M.M.<br><br>Abstract: Protein-DNA complexes play vital roles in many cellular processes by the interactions of amino acids with DNA. Several computational methods have been developed for predicting the interacting residues in DNA-binding proteins using sequence and/or structural information. These methods showed different levels of accuracies, which may depend on the choice of data sets used in training, the feature sets selected for developing a predictive model, the ability of the models to capture information useful for prediction or a combination of these factors. In many cases, different methods are likely to produce similar results, whereas in others, the predictors may return contradictory predictions. In this situation, a priori estimates of prediction performance applicable to the system being investigated would be helpful for biologists to choose the best method for designing their experiments. In this work, we have constructed unbiased, stringent and diverse data sets for DNA-binding proteins based on various biologically relevant considerations: (i) seven structural classes, (ii) 86 folds, (iii) 106 superfamilies, (iv) 194 families, (v) 15 binding motifs, (vi) single/double-stranded DNA, (vii) DNA conformation (A, B, Z, etc.), (viii) three functions and (ix) disordered regions. These data sets were culled as non-redundant with sequence identities of 25 and 40% and used to evaluate the performance of 11 different methods in which online services or standalone programs are available. We observed that the best performing methods for each of the data sets showed significant biases toward the data sets selected for their benchmark. Our analysis revealed important data set features, which could be used to estimate these context-specific biases and hence suggest the best method to be used for a given problem. We have developed a web server, which considers these features on demand and displays the best method that the investigator should use. The web server is freely available at http://www.biotech.iitm.ac.in/DNA-protein/. Further, we have grouped the methods based on their complexity and analyzed the performance. The information gained in this work could be effectively used to select the best method for designing experiments.","title":"Novel approach for selecting the best predictor for identifying the binding sites in DNA binding proteins","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23788679"},

Because manually detecting and following large numbers of individual particles is not feasible, automated computational methods have been developed for these tasks by many groups. Aiming to perform an objective comparison of methods, we gathered the community and organized an open competition in which participating teams applied their own methods independently to a commonly defined data set including diverse scenarios. Performance was assessed using commonly defined measures. Although no single method performed best across all scenarios, the results revealed clear differences between the various approaches, leading to notable practical conclusions for users and developers.","title":"Objective comparison of particle tracking methods","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24441936"},

{"description":"Authors: Perez-Riverol, Y., Wang, R., Hermjakob, H., Muller, M., Vesada, V., and Vizcaino, J.A.<br><br>Abstract: Data processing, management and visualization are central and critical components of a state of the art high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics experiment, and are often some of the most time-consuming steps, especially for labs without much bioinformatics support. The growing interest in the field of proteomics has triggered an increase in the development of new software libraries, including freely available and open-source software. From database search analysis to post-processing of the identification results, even though the objectives of these libraries and packages can vary significantly, they usually share a number of features. Common use cases include the handling of protein and peptide sequences, the parsing of results from various proteomics search engines output files, and the visualization of MS-related information (including mass spectra and chromatograms). In this review, we provide an overview of the existing software libraries, open-source frameworks and also, we give information on some of the freely available applications which make use of them.

Though there are some comparisons among these de novo assembly tools for assembling transcriptomes of different eukaryotic organisms, there is no report about the relationship between assembly strategies and ploidies of the organisms.<br>RESULTS: When we de novo assembled transcriptomes of sweet potato (hexaploid), Trametes gallica (a diploid fungus), Oryza meyeriana (a diploid wild rice), five assemblers, including Edena, Oases, Soaptrans, IDBA-tran and Trinity, were used in different strategies (Single-Assembler Single-Parameter, SASP; Single-Assembler Multiple-Parameters, SAMP; Combined De novo Transcriptome Assembly, CDTA, that is multiple assembler multiple parameter). It was found that CDTA strategy has the best performance compared with other two strategies for assembling transcriptome of the hexaploid sweet potato, whereas SAMP strategy with assembler Oases is better than other strategies for assembling transcriptomes of diploid fungus and the wild rice transcriptomes.<br>CONCLUSION: Based on the results from ours and others, it is suggested that CDTA strategy is better used for transcriptome assembly of polyploidy organisms and SAMP strategy of Oases is outperformed for those diploid organisms without genome sequences.","title":"Optimal assembly strategies of transcriptome related to ploidies of eukaryotic organisms","url":"http://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-014-1192-7"},
{"description":"Authors: Tam, S., Tsao, M.S., and McPherson, J.D.<br><br>Abstract: The past two decades of microRNA (miRNA) research has solidified the role of these small non-coding RNAs as key regulators of many biological processes and promising biomarkers for disease. The concurrent development in high-throughput profiling technology has further advanced our understanding of the impact of their dysregulation on a global scale. Currently, next-generation sequencing is the platform of choice for the discovery and quantification of miRNAs. Despite this, there is no clear consensus on how the data should be preprocessed before conducting downstream analyses. Often overlooked, data preprocessing is an essential step in data analysis: the presence of unreliable features and noise can affect the conclusions drawn from downstream analyses. Using a spike-in dilution study, we evaluated the effects of several general-purpose aligners (BWA, Bowtie, Bowtie 2 and Novoalign), and normalization methods (counts-per-million, total count scaling, upper quartile scaling, Trimmed Mean of M, DESeq, linear regression, cyclic loess and quantile) with respect to the final miRNA count data distribution, variance, bias and accuracy of differential expression analysis. We make practical recommendations on the optimal preprocessing methods for the extraction and interpretation of miRNA count data from small RNA-sequencing experiments.","title":"Optimization of miRNA-seq data preprocessing","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25888698"},

The original framework for modeling bacterial components and designing prokaryotic circuits evolved over the last years and brought, first, to the development of an algorithm for the automatic design of Boolean gene circuits. This is a remarkable achievement since gene digital circuits have a broad range of applications that goes from biosensors for health and environment care to computational devices. More recently, Parts &amp; Pools was enabled to give a proper formal description of eukaryotic biological circuit components. This was possible by employing a rule-based modeling approach, a technique that permits a faithful calculation of all the species and reactions involved in complex systems such as eukaryotic cells and compartments. In this way, Parts &amp; Pools is currently suitable for the visual and modular design of synthetic gene circuits in yeast and mammalian cells too.","title":"Parts &amp; pools: a framework for modular design of synthetic gene circuits","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25340051"},

We have used an Illumina exome-seq dataset as a benchmark, with two validation scenarios--family pedigree information and SNP array data for the same samples, permitting global high-throughput cross-validation, to evaluate the quality of SNP calls derived from several popular variant discovery tools from both the open-source and commercial communities using a set of designated quality metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale performance comparison of exome-seq variant discovery tools using high-throughput validation with both Mendelian inheritance checking and SNP array data, which allows us to gain insights into the accuracy of SNP calling through such high-throughput validation in an unprecedented way, whereas the previously reported comparison studies have only assessed concordance of these tools without directly assessing the quality of the derived SNPs. More importantly, the main purpose of our study was to establish a reusable procedure that applies high-throughput validation to compare the quality of SNP discovery tools with a focus on exome-seq, which can be used to compare any forthcoming tool(s) of interest.","title":"Performance comparison of SNP detection tools with illumina exome sequencing data--an assessment using both family pedigree information and sample-matched SNP array data","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24831545"},
{"description":"Authors: Pierre-Jean, M., Rigaill, G., and Neuvial, P.<br><br>Abstract: A number of bioinformatic or biostatistical methods are available for analyzing DNA copy number profiles measured from microarray or sequencing technologies. In the absence of rich enough gold standard data sets, the performance of these methods is generally assessed using unrealistic simulation studies, or based on small real data analyses. To make an objective and reproducible performance assessment, we have designed and implemented a framework to generate realistic DNA copy number profiles of cancer samples with known truth. These profiles are generated by resampling publicly available SNP microarray data from genomic regions with known copy-number state. The original data have been extracted from dilutions series of tumor cell lines with matched blood samples at several concentrations. Therefore, the signal-to-noise ratio of the generated profiles can be controlled through the (known) percentage of tumor cells in the sample. This article describes this framework and its application to a comparison study between methods for segmenting DNA copy number profiles from SNP microarrays. This study indicates that no single method is uniformly better than all others. It also helps identifying pros and cons of the compared methods as a function of biologically informative parameters, such as the fraction of tumor cells in the sample and the proportion of heterozygous markers. This comparison study may be reproduced using the open source and cross-platform R package jointseg, which implements the proposed data generation and evaluation framework: http://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1562.","title":"Performance evaluation of DNA copy number segmentation methods","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25202135"},

Unlike inherited variants, cancer mutations may occur at low frequencies because of contamination from normal cells or tumor heterogeneity and can therefore be challenging to detect using common NGS analysis tools, which are often designed for constitutional genomic studies. We generated high-coverage (&gt;1000x) NGS data from synthetic DNA mixtures with variant allele fractions (VAFs) of 25% to 2.5% to assess the performance of four variant callers, SAMtools, Genome Analysis Toolkit, VarScan2, and SPLINTER, in detecting low-frequency variants. SAMtools had the lowest sensitivity and detected only 49% of variants with VAFs of approximately 25%; whereas the Genome Analysis Toolkit, VarScan2, and SPLINTER detected at least 94% of variants with VAFs of approximately 10%. VarScan2 and SPLINTER achieved sensitivities of 97% and 89%, respectively, for variants with observed VAFs of 1% to 8%, with &gt;98% sensitivity and &gt;99% positive predictive value in coding regions. Coverage analysis demonstrated that &gt;500x coverage was required for optimal performance. The specificity of SPLINTER improved with higher coverage, whereas VarScan2 yielded more false positive results at high coverage levels, although this effect was abrogated by removing low-quality reads before variant identification. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of high-sensitivity variant callers with data from 15 clinical lung cancers.","title":"Performance of common analysis methods for detecting low-frequency single nucleotide variants in targeted next-generation sequence data","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24211364"},

Stability changes are often found for mutated proteins involved in diseases. Stability predictors computationally predict protein-stability changes caused by mutations. We performed a systematic analysis of 11 online stability predictors' performances. These predictors are CUPSAT, Dmutant, FoldX, I-Mutant2.0, two versions of I-Mutant3.0 (sequence and structure versions), MultiMutate, MUpro, SCide, Scpred, and SRide. As input, 1,784 single mutations found in 80 proteins were used, and these mutations did not include those used for training. The programs' performances were also assessed according to where the mutations were found in the proteins, that is, in secondary structures and on the surface or in the core of a protein, and according to protein structure type. The extents to which the mutations altered the occupied volumes at the residue sites and the charge interactions were also characterized. The predictions of all programs were in line with the experimental data. I-Mutant3.0 (utilizing structural information), Dmutant, and FoldX were the most reliable predictors. The stability-center predictors performed with similar accuracy. However, at best, the predictions were only moderately accurate (approximately 60%) and significantly better tools would be needed for routine analysis of mutation effects.","title":"Performance of protein stability predictors","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20232415"},

{"description":"Authors: Ching, T., Huang, S., and Garmire, L.X.<br><br>Abstract: It is crucial for researchers to optimize RNA-seq experimental designs for differential expression detection. Currently, the field lacks general methods to estimate power and sample size for RNA-Seq in complex experimental designs, under the assumption of the negative binomial distribution. We simulate RNA-Seq count data based on parameters estimated from six widely different public data sets (including cell line comparison, tissue comparison, and cancer data sets) and calculate the statistical power in paired and unpaired sample experiments. We comprehensively compare five differential expression analysis packages (DESeq, edgeR, DESeq2, sSeq, and EBSeq) and evaluate their performance by power, receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, and other metrics including areas under the curve (AUC), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and F-measures. DESeq2 and edgeR tend to give the best performance in general. Increasing sample size or sequencing depth increases power; however, increasing sample size is more potent than sequencing depth to increase power, especially when the sequencing depth reaches 20 million reads. Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNA) yields lower power relative to the protein coding mRNAs, given their lower expression level in the same RNA-Seq experiment. On the other hand, paired-sample RNA-Seq significantly enhances the statistical power, confirming the importance of considering the multifactor experimental design. Finally, a local optimal power is achievable for a given budget constraint, and the dominant contributing factor is sample size rather than the sequencing depth. In conclusion, we provide a power analysis tool (http://www2.hawaii.edu/~lgarmire/RNASeqPowerCalculator.htm) that captures the dispersion in the data and can serve as a practical reference under the budget constraint of RNA-Seq experiments.","title":"Power analysis and sample size estimation for RNA-Seq differential expression","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25246651"},

Accurate prediction of a protein's predisposition to be intrinsically disordered is a necessary prerequisite for the further understanding of principles and mechanisms of protein folding and function, and is a key for the elaboration of a new structural and functional hierarchy of proteins. Therefore, prediction of IDPs has attracted the attention of many researchers, and a number of prediction tools have been developed. Predictions of disorder, in turn, are playing major roles in directing laboratory experiments that are leading to the discovery of ever more disordered proteins, and thereby leading to a positive feedback loop in the investigation of these proteins. In this review of algorithms for intrinsic disorder prediction, the basic concepts of various prediction methods for IDPs are summarized, the strengths and shortcomings of many of the methods are analyzed, and the difficulties and directions of future development of IDP prediction techniques are discussed.","title":"Predicting intrinsic disorder in proteins: an overview","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19597536"},

The next obvious task is to figure out how various parts interact with each other. On that account, we review 10 methods for protein interface prediction, which are freely available as web servers. In addition, we comparatively evaluate their performance on a common data set comprising different quality target structures. We find that using experimental structures and high-quality homology models, structure-based methods outperform those using only protein sequences, with global template-based approaches providing the best performance. For moderate-quality models, sequence-based methods often perform better than those structure-based techniques that rely on fine atomic details. We note that post-processing protocols implemented in several methods quantitatively improve the results only for experimental structures, suggesting that these procedures should be tuned up for computer-generated models. Finally, we anticipate that advanced meta-prediction protocols are likely to enhance interface residue prediction. Notwithstanding further improvements, easily accessible web servers already provide the scientific community with convenient resources for the identification of protein-protein interaction sites.","title":"Predicting protein interface residues using easily accessible on-line resources","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25797794"},

A core principle of the synthetic biology approach is a model-guided design and based on the biological understanding of the process, models of prokaryotic protein production have been described. Translation initiation rate is a rate-limiting step in protein production from mRNA and is dependent on the sequence of the 5'-untranslated region and the start of the coding sequence. Translation rate calculators are programs that estimate protein translation rates based on the sequence of these regions of an mRNA, and as protein expression is proportional to the rate of translation initiation, such calculators have been shown to give good approximations of protein expression levels. In this review, three currently available translation rate calculators developed for synthetic biology are considered, with limitations and possible future progress discussed.","title":"Predicting translation initiation rates for designing synthetic biology","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25152877"},

This massive network is evidenced by several recent experimental discoveries of large numbers of previously unknown RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Meanwhile, more than 400 non-redundant protein-RNA complex structures (at 25% sequence identity or less) have been deposited into the protein databank. These sequences and structural resources for RBPs provide ample data for the development of computational techniques dedicated to RBP prediction, as experimentally determining RNA-binding functions is time-consuming and expensive. This review compares traditional machine-learning based approaches with emerging template-based methods at several levels of prediction resolution ranging from two-state binding/non-binding prediction, to binding residue prediction and protein-RNA complex structure prediction. The analysis indicates that the two approaches are complementary and their combinations may lead to further improvements.","title":"Prediction of RNA binding proteins comes of age from low resolution to high resolution","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23872922"},

{"description":"Authors: Bendl, J., Stourac, J., Salanda, O., Pavelka, A., Wieben, E.D., Zendulka, J., Brezovsky, J., and Damborsky, J.<br><br>Abstract: Single nucleotide variants represent a prevalent form of genetic variation. Mutations in the coding regions are frequently associated with the development of various genetic diseases. Computational tools for the prediction of the effects of mutations on protein function are very important for analysis of single nucleotide variants and their prioritization for experimental characterization. Many computational tools are already widely employed for this purpose. Unfortunately, their comparison and further improvement is hindered by large overlaps between the training datasets and benchmark datasets, which lead to biased and overly optimistic reported performances. In this study, we have constructed three independent datasets by removing all duplicities, inconsistencies and mutations previously used in the training of evaluated tools. The benchmark dataset containing over 43,000 mutations was employed for the unbiased evaluation of eight established prediction tools: MAPP, nsSNPAnalyzer, PANTHER, PhD-SNP, PolyPhen-1, PolyPhen-2, SIFT and SNAP. The six best performing tools were combined into a consensus classifier PredictSNP, resulting into significantly improved prediction performance, and at the same time returned results for all mutations, confirming that consensus prediction represents an accurate and robust alternative to the predictions delivered by individual tools. A user-friendly web interface enables easy access to all eight prediction tools, the consensus classifier PredictSNP and annotations from the Protein Mutant Database and the UniProt database. The web server and the datasets are freely available to the academic community at http://loschmidt.chemi.muni.cz/predictsnp.","title":"PredictSNP: robust and accurate consensus classifier for prediction of disease-related mutations","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24453961"},

In recent years a significant number of methods have been developed to predict these interface residues and here we review the current status of the field. Progress in this area requires a clear view of the methodology applied, the data sets used for training and testing the systems, and the evaluation procedures. We have analysed the impact of a representative set of features and algorithms and highlighted the problems inherent in generating reliable protein data sets and in the posterior analysis of the results. Although it is clear that there have been some improvements in methods for predicting interacting sites, several major bottlenecks remain. Proteins in complexes are still under-represented in the structural databases and in particular many proteins involved in transient complexes are still to be crystallized. We provide suggestions for effective feature selection, and make it clear that community standards for testing, training and performance measures are necessary for progress in the field.","title":"Progress and challenges in predicting protein-protein interaction sites","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19346321"},

{"description":"Authors: Yaveroglu, O.N., Milenkovic, T., and Przulj, N.<br><br>Abstract: MOTIVATION: Network comparison is a computationally intractable problem with important applications in systems biology and other domains. A key challenge is to properly quantify similarity between wiring patterns of two networks in an alignment-free fashion. Also, alignment-based methods exist that aim to identify an actual node mapping between networks and as such serve a different purpose. Various alignment-free methods that use different global network properties (e.g., degree distribution) have been proposed. Methods based on small local subgraphs called graphlets perform the best in the alignment-free network comparison task, due to high level of topological detail that graphlets can capture (Yaveroglu et al., 2014). Among different graphlet-based methods, Graphlet Correlation Distance (GCD) was shown to be the most accurate for comparing networks. Recently, a new graphlet-based method called NetDis was proposed, which was claimed to be superior. We argue against this, as the performance of NetDis was not properly evaluated to position it correctly among the other alignment-free methods.<br>RESULTS: We evaluate the performance of available alignment-free network comparison methods, including GCD and NetDis. We do this by measuring accuracy of each method (in a systematic precision-recall framework) in terms of how well the method can group (cluster) topologically similar networks. By testing this on both synthetic and real-world networks from different domains, we show that GCD remains the most accurate, noise-tolerant, and computationally efficient alignment-free method. That is, we show that NetDis does not outperform the other methods, as originally claimed, while it is also computationally more expensive. Furthermore, since NetDis is dependent on the choice of a network null model (unlike the other graphlet-based methods), we show that its performance is highly sensitive to the choice of this parameter. Finally, we find that its performance is not independent on network sizes and densities, as originally claimed.<br>CONTACT: natasha@imperial.ac.uk.","title":"Proper Evaluation of Alignment-Free Network Comparison Methods","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25810431"},

{"description":"Authors: Grosdidier, S., and Fernandez-Recio, J.<br><br>Abstract: Most processes in living organisms occur through an intricate network of protein-protein interactions, in which any malfunctioning can lead to pathological situations. Therefore, current research in biomedicine is starting to focus on protein interaction networks. A detailed structural knowledge of these interactions at molecular level will be necessary for drug discovery targeting protein-protein interactions. The challenge from a structural biology point of view is determining the structure of the specific complex formed upon interaction of two or several proteins, and/or locating the surface residues involved in the interaction and identify which of them are the most important ones for binding (hot-spots). In this line, an increasing number of computer tools are available to complement experimental efforts. Docking algorithms can achieve successful predictive rates in many complexes, as shown in the community assessment experiment CAPRI, and have already been applied to a variety of cases of biomedical interest. On the other side, many methods for interface and hotspot prediction have been reported, based on a variety of evolutionary, geometrical and physico-chemical parameters. Computer predictions are reaching a significant level of maturity, and can be very useful to guide experiments and suggest mutations, or to provide a mechanistic framework to the experimental results on a given interaction. We will review here existing computer approaches for proteinprotein docking, interface prediction and hot-spot identification, with focus to drug discovery targeting protein-protein interactions.","title":"Protein-protein docking and hot-spot prediction for drug discovery","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22650255"},

{"description":"Authors: Walia, R.R., Caragea, C., Lewis, B.A., Towfic, F., Terribilini, M., El-Manzalawy, Y., Dobbs, D., and Honavar, V.<br><br>Abstract: BACKGROUND: RNA molecules play diverse functional and structural roles in cells. They function as messengers for transferring genetic information from DNA to proteins, as the primary genetic material in many viruses, as catalysts (ribozymes) important for protein synthesis and RNA processing, and as essential and ubiquitous regulators of gene expression in living organisms. Many of these functions depend on precisely orchestrated interactions between RNA molecules and specific proteins in cells. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which proteins recognize and bind RNA is essential for comprehending the functional implications of these interactions, but the recognition 'code' that mediates interactions between proteins and RNA is not yet understood. Success in deciphering this code would dramatically impact the development of new therapeutic strategies for intervening in devastating diseases such as AIDS and cancer. Because of the high cost of experimental determination of protein-RNA interfaces, there is an increasing reliance on statistical machine learning methods for training predictors of RNA-binding residues in proteins. However, because of differences in the choice of datasets, performance measures, and data representations used, it has been difficult to obtain an accurate assessment of the current state of the art in protein-RNA interface prediction.<br>RESULTS: We provide a review of published approaches for predicting RNA-binding residues in proteins and a systematic comparison and critical assessment of protein-RNA interface residue predictors trained using these approaches on three carefully curated non-redundant datasets. We directly compare two widely used machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) using three different data representations in which features are encoded using either sequence- or structure-based windows. Our results show that (i) Sequence-based classifiers that use a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM)-based representation (PSSMSeq) outperform those that use an amino acid identity based representation (IDSeq) or a smoothed PSSM (SmoPSSMSeq); (ii) Structure-based classifiers that use smoothed PSSM representation (SmoPSSMStr) outperform those that use PSSM (PSSMStr) as well as sequence identity based representation (IDStr). PSSMSeq classifiers, when tested on an independent test set of 44 proteins, achieve performance that is comparable to that of three state-of-the-art structure-based predictors (including those that exploit geometric features) in terms of Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), although the structure-based methods achieve substantially higher Specificity (albeit at the expense of Sensitivity) compared to sequence-based methods. We also find that the expected performance of the classifiers on a residue level can be markedly different from that on a protein level. Our experiments show that the classifiers trained on three different non-redundant protein-RNA interface datasets achieve comparable cross-validation performance. However, we find that the results are significantly affected by differences in the distance threshold used to define interface residues.<br>CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that protein-RNA interface residue predictors that use a PSSM-based encoding of sequence windows outperform classifiers that use other encodings of sequence windows. While structure-based methods that exploit geometric features can yield significant increases in the Specificity of protein-RNA interface residue predictions, such increases are offset by decreases in Sensitivity. These results underscore the importance of comparing alternative methods using rigorous statistical procedures, multiple performance measures, and datasets that are constructed based on several alternative definitions of interface residues and redundancy cutoffs as well as including evaluations on independent test sets into the comparisons.","title":"Protein-RNA interface residue prediction using machine learning: an assessment of the state of the art","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22574904"},

{"description":"Authors: Nolan, T., Hands, R.E., and Bustin, S.A.<br><br>Abstract: The real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) addresses the evident requirement for quantitative data analysis in molecular medicine, biotechnology, microbiology and diagnostics and has become the method of choice for the quantification of mRNA. Although it is often described as a \"gold\" standard, it is far from being a standard assay. The significant problems caused by variability of RNA templates, assay designs and protocols, as well as inappropriate data normalization and inconsistent data analysis, are widely known but also widely disregarded. As a first step towards standardization, we describe a series of RT-qPCR protocols that illustrate the essential technical steps required to generate quantitative data that are reliable and reproducible. We would like to emphasize, however, that RT-qPCR data constitute only a snapshot of information regarding the quantity of a given transcript in a cell or tissue. Any assessment of the biological consequences of variable mRNA levels must include additional information regarding regulatory RNAs, protein levels and protein activity. The entire protocol described here, encompassing all stages from initial assay design to reliable qPCR data analysis, requires approximately 15 h.","title":"Quantification of mRNA using real-time RT-PCR","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17406449"},

In addition to reviewing the association analysis methods for rare variants, we discuss the limitations of genome-wide association studies in identifying rare variants and the problems that arise in the imputation of rare variants.","title":"Rare variant association analysis methods for complex traits","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21047260"},

{"description":"Author: Ritchie, D.W.<br><br>Abstract: This article gives an overview of recent progress in protein-protein docking and it identifies several directions for future research. Recent results from the CAPRI blind docking experiments show that docking algorithms are steadily improving in both reliability and accuracy. Current docking algorithms employ a range of efficient search and scoring strategies, including e.g. fast Fourier transform correlations, geometric hashing, and Monte Carlo techniques. These approaches can often produce a relatively small list of up to a few thousand orientations, amongst which a near-native binding mode is often observed. However, despite the use of improved scoring functions which typically include models of desolvation, hydrophobicity, and electrostatics, current algorithms still have difficulty in identifying the correct solution from the list of false positives, or decoys. Nonetheless, significant progress is being made through better use of bioinformatics, biochemical, and biophysical information such as e.g. sequence conservation analysis, protein interaction databases, alanine scanning, and NMR residual dipolar coupling restraints to help identify key binding residues. Promising new approaches to incorporate models of protein flexibility during docking are being developed, including the use of molecular dynamics snapshots, rotameric and off-rotamer searches, internal coordinate mechanics, and principal component analysis based techniques. Some investigators now use explicit solvent models in their docking protocols. Many of these approaches can be computationally intensive, although new silicon chip technologies such as programmable graphics processor units are beginning to offer competitive alternatives to conventional high performance computer systems. As cryo-EM techniques improve apace, docking NMR and X-ray protein structures into low resolution EM density maps is helping to bridge the resolution gap between these complementary techniques. The use of symmetry and fragment assembly constraints are also helping to make possible docking-based predictions of large multimeric protein complexes. In the near future, the closer integration of docking algorithms with protein interface prediction software, structural databases, and sequence analysis techniques should help produce better predictions of protein interaction networks and more accurate structural models of the fundamental molecular interactions within the cell.","title":"Recent progress and future directions in protein-protein docking","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18336319"},

In this Review, we discuss these varied technical challenges and solutions for sequencing ancient genomes and epigenomes.","title":"Reconstructing ancient genomes and epigenomes","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26055157"},

The amplicon-based metagenomics approach involves the PCR-targeted sequencing of a genetic locus fitting different features. Namely, it must be ubiquitous in the taxonomic range of interest, variable enough to discriminate between different species but flanked by highly conserved sequences, and of suitable size to be sequenced through next-generation platforms. The internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 (ITS1 and ITS2) of the ribosomal DNA operon and one or more hyper-variable regions of 16S ribosomal RNA gene are typically used to identify fungal and bacterial species, respectively. In this context, reliable reference databases and taxonomies are crucial to assign amplicon sequence reads to the correct phylogenetic ranks. Several resources provide consistent phylogenetic classification of publicly available 16S ribosomal DNA sequences, whereas the state of ribosomal internal transcribed spacers reference databases is notably less advanced. In this review, we aim to give an overview of existing reference resources for both types of markers, highlighting strengths and possible shortcomings of their use for metagenomics purposes. Moreover, we present a new database, ITSoneDB, of well annotated and phylogenetically classified ITS1 sequences to be used as a reference collection in metagenomic studies of environmental fungal communities.

{"description":"Authors: Kozera, B., and Rapacz, M.<br><br>Abstract: This paper aims to discuss various aspects of the use of reference genes in qPCR technique used in the thousands of present studies. Most frequently, these are housekeeping genes and they must meet several criteria so that they can lay claim to the name. Lots of papers report that in different conditions, for different organisms and even tissues the basic assumption-the constant level of the expression is not maintained for many genes that seem to be perfect candidates. Moreover, their transcription can not be affected by experimental factors. Sounds simple and clear but a great number of designed protocols and lack of consistency among them brings confusion on how to perform experiment properly. Since during selection of the most stable normalizing gene we can not use any reference gene, different ways and algorithms for their selection were developed. Such methods, including examples of best normalizing genes in some specific cases and possible mistakes are presented based on available sources. Numerous examples of reference genes applications, which are usually in too few numbers in relevant articles not allowing to make a solid fundament for a reader, will be shown along with instructive compilations to make an evidence for presented statements and an arrangement of future qPCR experiments. To include all the pitfalls and problems associated with the normalization methods there is no way not to begin from sample preparation and its storage going through candidate gene selection, primer design and statistical analysis. This is important because numerous short reviews available cover the topic only in lesser extent at the same time giving the reader false conviction of complete topic recognition.","title":"Reference genes in real-time PCR","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24078518"},

However, the data produced by the thousands of microarray studies published annually are confounded by \"batch effects,\" the systematic error introduced when samples are processed in multiple batches. Although batch effects can be reduced by careful experimental design, they cannot be eliminated unless the whole study is done in a single batch. A number of programs are now available to adjust microarray data for batch effects prior to analysis. We systematically evaluated six of these programs using multiple measures of precision, accuracy and overall performance. ComBat, an Empirical Bayes method, outperformed the other five programs by most metrics. We also showed that it is essential to standardize expression data at the probe level when testing for correlation of expression profiles, due to a sizeable probe effect in microarray data that can inflate the correlation among replicates and unrelated samples.","title":"Removing batch effects in analysis of expression microarray data: an evaluation of six batch adjustment methods","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21386892"},

Repeats have always presented technical challenges for sequence alignment and assembly programs. Next-generation sequencing projects, with their short read lengths and high data volumes, have made these challenges more difficult. From a computational perspective, repeats create ambiguities in alignment and assembly, which, in turn, can produce biases and errors when interpreting results. Simply ignoring repeats is not an option, as this creates problems of its own and may mean that important biological phenomena are missed. We discuss the computational problems surrounding repeats and describe strategies used by current bioinformatics systems to solve them.","title":"Repetitive DNA and next-generation sequencing: computational challenges and solutions","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22124482"},

Instrumentation software has advanced to the point that thousands of transitions (pairs of primary and secondary m/z values) can be measured in a triple quadrupole instrument coupled to an LC, by a well-designed scheduling and selection of m/z windows. The design of a good MRM assay relies on the availability of peptide spectra from previous discovery-phase LC-MS/MS studies. The tedious aspect of manually developing and processing MRM assays involving thousands of transitions has spurred to development of software tools to automate this process. Software packages have been developed for project management, assay development, assay validation, data export, peak integration, quality assessment, and biostatistical analysis. No single tool provides a complete end-to-end solution, thus this article reviews the current state and discusses future directions of these software tools in order to enable researchers to combine these tools for a comprehensive targeted proteomics workflow.","title":"Review of software tools for design and analysis of large scale MRM proteomic datasets","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23702368"},

{"description":"Authors: Naeem, H., Zimmer, R., Tavakkolkhah, P., and Kuffner, R.<br><br>Abstract: MOTIVATION: Several statistical tests are available to detect the enrichment of differential expression in gene sets. Such tests were originally proposed for analyzing gene sets associated with biological processes. The objective evaluation of tests on real measurements has not been possible as it is difficult to decide a priori, which processes will be affected in given experiments.<br>RESULTS: We present a first large study to rigorously assess and compare the performance of gene set enrichment tests on real expression measurements. Gene sets are defined based on the targets of given regulators such as transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). In contrast to processes, TFs and miRNAs are amenable to direct perturbations, e.g. regulator over-expression or deletion. We assess the ability of 14 different statistical tests to predict the perturbations from expression measurements in Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human. We also analyze how performance depends on the quality and comprehensiveness of the regulator targets via a permutation approach. We find that ANOVA and Wilcoxons test consistently perform better than for instance Kolmogorov-Smirnov and hypergeometric tests. For scenarios where the optimal test is not known, we suggest to combine all evaluated tests into an unweighted consensus, which also performs well in our assessment. Our results provide a guide for the selection of existing tests as well as a basis for the development and assessment of novel tests.","title":"Rigorous assessment of gene set enrichment tests","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22492315"},

This contribution discusses the methods available for predicting RNA structure. Secondary structure is the set of the canonical base pairs, and secondary structure can be accurately determined by comparative sequence analysis. Secondary structure can also be predicted. The most commonly used method is free energy minimization. The accuracy of structure prediction is improved either by using experimental mapping data or by predicting a structure conserved in a set of homologous sequences. Additionally, tertiary structure, the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms, can be modeled with guidance from comparative analysis and experimental techniques. New approaches are also available for predicting tertiary structure.","title":"RNA structure prediction: an overview of methods","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22736001"},

Thoughtful experimental design and choice of analysis tools are critical to ensure high-quality data and interpretable results. Important considerations for experimental design include number of replicates, whether to collect paired-end or single-end reads, sequence length, and sequencing depth. Common analysis steps in all RNA-seq experiments include quality control, read alignment, assigning reads to genes or transcripts, and estimating gene or transcript abundance. Our aims are two-fold: to make recommendations for common components of experimental design and assess tool capabilities for each of these steps. We also test tools designed to detect differential expression, since this is the most widespread application of RNA-seq. We hope that these analyses will help guide those who are new to RNA-seq and will generate discussion about remaining needs for tool improvement and development. Curr. Protoc. Hum.

Many RNA-seq studies have used insufficient biological replicates, resulting in low statistical power and inefficient use of sequencing resources.<br>RESULTS: We show the explicit trade-off between more biological replicates and deeper sequencing in increasing power to detect differentially expressed (DE) genes. In the human cell line MCF7, adding more sequencing depth after 10 M reads gives diminishing returns on power to detect DE genes, whereas adding biological replicates improves power significantly regardless of sequencing depth. We also propose a cost-effectiveness metric for guiding the design of large-scale RNA-seq DE studies. Our analysis showed that sequencing less reads and performing more biological replication is an effective strategy to increase power and accuracy in large-scale differential expression RNA-seq studies, and provided new insights into efficient experiment design of RNA-seq studies.<br>AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code used in this paper is provided on: http://home.uchicago.edu/ approximately jiezhou/replication/.

{"description":"Authors: Cao, M.D., Balasubramanian, S., and Boden, M.<br><br>Abstract: Short tandem repeats are highly polymorphic and associated with a wide range of phenotypic variation, some of which cause neurodegenerative disease in humans. With advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, there are novel opportunities to study genetic variation. While available sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools provide options for mining high-throughput sequencing data, their suitability for analysis of repeat variation is an open question, with tools for quantifying variability in repetitive sequence still in their infancy. We present here a comprehensive survey and empirical evaluation of current sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools in all stages of an analysis pipeline. While there is not one optimal pipeline to suit all circumstances, we find that the choice of alignment and repeat genotyping tools greatly impacts the accuracy and efficiency by which short tandem repeat variation can be detected. We further note that to detect variation relevant to many repeat diseases, it is essential to choose technologies that offer either long read-lengths or paired-end sequencing, coupled with specific genotyping tools.","title":"Sequencing technologies and tools for short tandem repeat variation detection","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24504770"},

{"description":"Authors: Ding, H., Takigawa, I., Mamitsuka, H., and Zhu, S.<br><br>Abstract: Computationally predicting drug-target interactions is useful to select possible drug (or target) candidates for further biochemical verification. We focus on machine learning-based approaches, particularly similarity-based methods that use drug and target similarities, which show relationships among drugs and those among targets, respectively. These two similarities represent two emerging concepts, the chemical space and the genomic space. Typically, the methods combine these two types of similarities to generate models for predicting new drug-target interactions. This process is also closely related to a lot of work in pharmacogenomics or chemical biology that attempt to understand the relationships between the chemical and genomic spaces. This background makes the similarity-based approaches attractive and promising. This article reviews the similarity-based machine learning methods for predicting drug-target interactions, which are state-of-the-art and have aroused great interest in bioinformatics. We describe each of these methods briefly, and empirically compare these methods under a uniform experimental setting to explore their advantages and limitations.","title":"Similarity-based machine learning methods for predicting drug-target interactions: a brief review","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23933754"},

DDI detection is, therefore, an important objective in patient safety, one whose pursuit affects drug development and pharmacovigilance. In this article, we describe a protocol applicable on a large scale to predict novel DDIs based on similarity of drug interaction candidates to drugs involved in established DDIs. The method integrates a reference standard database of known DDIs with drug similarity information extracted from different sources, such as 2D and 3D molecular structure, interaction profile, target and side-effect similarities. The method is interpretable in that it generates drug interaction candidates that are traceable to pharmacological or clinical effects. We describe a protocol with applications in patient safety and preclinical toxicity screening. The time frame to implement this protocol is 5-7 h, with additional time potentially necessary, depending on the complexity of the reference standard DDI database and the similarity measures implemented.","title":"Similarity-based modeling in large-scale prediction of drug-drug interactions","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25122524"},

{"description":"Authors: Lakshmanan, M., Koh, G., Chung, B.K., and Lee, D.Y.<br><br>Abstract: Flux balance analysis (FBA) is a widely used computational method for characterizing and engineering intrinsic cellular metabolism. The increasing number of its successful applications and growing popularity are possibly attributable to the availability of specific software tools for FBA. Each tool has its unique features and limitations with respect to operational environment, user-interface and supported analysis algorithms. Presented herein is an in-depth evaluation of currently available FBA applications, focusing mainly on usability, functionality, graphical representation and inter-operability. Overall, most of the applications are able to perform basic features of model creation and FBA simulation. COBRA toolbox, OptFlux and FASIMU are versatile to support advanced in silico algorithms to identify environmental and genetic targets for strain design. SurreyFBA, WEbcoli, Acorn, FAME, GEMSiRV and MetaFluxNet are the distinct tools which provide the user friendly interfaces in model handling. In terms of software architecture, FBA-SimVis and OptFlux have the flexible environments as they enable the plug-in/add-on feature to aid prospective functional extensions. Notably, an increasing trend towards the implementation of more tailored e-services such as central model repository and assistance to collaborative efforts was observed among the web-based applications with the help of advanced web-technologies. Furthermore, most recent applications such as the Model SEED, FAME, MetaFlux and MicrobesFlux have even included several routines to facilitate the reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic models. Finally, a brief discussion on the future directions of FBA applications was made for the benefit of potential tool developers.","title":"Software applications for flux balance analysis","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23131418"},

Metabolic modeling elucidates in silico all the possible flux pathways (flux balance analysis, FBA) and predicts the actual fluxes under a given situation, further refinement of these models is possible by including experimental isotopologue data. In this review, we initially introduce the key theoretical concepts and different analysis steps in the modeling process before comparing flux calculation and metabolite analysis programs such as C13, BioOpt, COBRA toolbox, Metatool, efmtool, FiatFlux, ReMatch, VANTED, iMAT and YANA. Their respective strengths and limitations are discussed and compared to alternative software. While data analysis of metabolites, calculation of metabolic fluxes, pathways and their condition-specific changes are all possible, we highlight the considerations that need to be taken into account before deciding on a specific software. Current challenges in the field include the computation of large-scale networks (in elementary mode analysis), regulatory interactions and detailed kinetics, and these are discussed in the light of powerful new approaches.","title":"Software applications toward quantitative metabolic flux analysis and modeling","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23142828"},
{"description":"Authors: Eckel-Passow, J.E., Atkinson, E.J., Maharjan, S., Kardia, S.L., and de Andrade, M.<br><br>Abstract: BACKGROUND: Copy number data are routinely being extracted from genome-wide association study chips using a variety of software. We empirically evaluated and compared four freely-available software packages designed for Affymetrix SNP chips to estimate copy number: Affymetrix Power Tools (APT), Aroma.Affymetrix, PennCNV and CRLMM. Our evaluation used 1,418 GENOA samples that were genotyped on the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0. We compared bias and variance in the locus-level copy number data, the concordance amongst regions of copy number gains/deletions and the false-positive rate amongst deleted segments.<br>RESULTS: APT had median locus-level copy numbers closest to a value of two, whereas PennCNV and Aroma.Affymetrix had the smallest variability associated with the median copy number. Of those evaluated, only PennCNV provides copy number specific quality-control metrics and identified 136 poor CNV samples. Regions of copy number variation (CNV) were detected using the hidden Markov models provided within PennCNV and CRLMM/VanillaIce. PennCNV detected more CNVs than CRLMM/VanillaIce; the median number of CNVs detected per sample was 39 and 30, respectively. PennCNV detected most of the regions that CRLMM/VanillaIce did as well as additional CNV regions. The median concordance between PennCNV and CRLMM/VanillaIce was 47.9% for duplications and 51.5% for deletions. The estimated false-positive rate associated with deletions was similar for PennCNV and CRLMM/VanillaIce.<br>CONCLUSIONS: If the objective is to perform statistical tests on the locus-level copy number data, our empirical results suggest that PennCNV or Aroma.Affymetrix is optimal. If the objective is to perform statistical tests on the summarized segmented data then PennCNV would be preferred over CRLMM/VanillaIce. Specifically, PennCNV allows the analyst to estimate locus-level copy number, perform segmentation and evaluate CNV-specific quality-control metrics within a single software package. PennCNV has relatively small bias, small variability and detects more regions while maintaining a similar estimated false-positive rate as CRLMM/VanillaIce. More generally, we advocate that software developers need to provide guidance with respect to evaluating and choosing optimal settings in order to obtain optimal results for an individual dataset. Until such guidance exists, we recommend trying multiple algorithms, evaluating concordance/discordance and subsequently consider the union of regions for downstream association tests.","title":"Software comparison for evaluating genomic copy number variation for Affymetrix 6.0 SNP array platform","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21627824"},
{"description":"Authors: Brezovsky, J., Chovancova, E., Gora, A., Pavelka, A., Biedermannova, L., and Damborsky, J.<br><br>Abstract: Protein structures contain highly complex systems of voids, making up specific features such as surface clefts or grooves, pockets, protrusions, cavities, pores or channels, and tunnels. Many of them are essential for the migration of solvents, ions and small molecules through proteins, and their binding to the functional sites. Analysis of these structural features is very important for understanding of structure-function relationships, for the design of potential inhibitors or proteins with improved functional properties. Here we critically review existing software tools specialized in rapid identification, visualization, analysis and design of protein tunnels and channels. The strengths and weaknesses of individual tools are reported together with examples of their applications for the analysis and engineering of various biological systems. This review can assist users with selecting a proper software tool for study of their biological problem as well as highlighting possible avenues for further development of existing tools. Development of novel descriptors representing not only geometry, but also electrostatics, hydrophobicity or dynamics, is needed for reliable identification of biologically relevant tunnels and channels.","title":"Software tools for identification, visualization and analysis of protein tunnels and channels","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22349130"},

{"description":"Authors: Carrara, M., Beccuti, M., Cavallo, F., Donatelli, S., Lazzarato, F., Cordero, F., and Calogero, R.A.<br><br>Abstract: BACKGROUND: RNA-seq has the potential to discover genes created by chromosomal rearrangements. Fusion genes, also known as \"chimeras\", are formed by the breakage and re-joining of two different chromosomes. It is known that chimeras have been implicated in the development of cancer. Few publications in the past showed the presence of fusion events also in normal tissue, but with very limited overlaps between their results. More recently, two fusion genes in normal tissues were detected using both RNA-seq and protein data.Due to heterogeneous results in identifying chimeras in normal tissue, we decided to evaluate the efficacy of state of the art fusion finders in detecting chimeras in RNA-seq data from normal tissues.<br>RESULTS: We compared the performance of six fusion-finder tools: FusionHunter, FusionMap, FusionFinder, MapSplice, deFuse and TopHat-fusion. To evaluate the sensitivity we used a synthetic dataset of fusion-products, called positive dataset; in these experiments FusionMap, FusionFinder, MapSplice, and TopHat-fusion are able to detect more than 78% of fusion genes. All tools were error prone with high variability among the tools, identifying some fusion genes not present in the synthetic dataset. To better investigate the false discovery chimera detection rate, synthetic datasets free of fusion-products, called negative datasets, were used. The negative datasets have different read lengths and quality scores, which allow detecting dependency of the tools on both these features. FusionMap, FusionFinder, mapSplice, deFuse and TopHat-fusion were error-prone. Only FusionHunter results were free of false positive. FusionMap gave the best compromise in terms of specificity in the negative dataset and of sensitivity in the positive dataset.<br>CONCLUSIONS: We have observed a dependency of the tools on read length, quality score and on the number of reads supporting each chimera. Thus, it is important to carefully select the software on the basis of the structure of the RNA-seq data under analysis. Furthermore, the sensitivity of chimera detection tools does not seem to be sufficient to provide results consistent with those obtained in normal tissues on the basis of fusion events extracted from published data.","title":"State of art fusion-finder algorithms are suitable to detect transcription-induced chimeras in normal tissues?","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23815381"},

RNA-seq has the potential to discover such rearrangements generating functional proteins (chimera/fusion). Recently, many methods for chimeras detection have been published. However, specificity and sensitivity of those tools were not extensively investigated in a comparative way.<br>RESULTS: We tested eight fusion-detection tools (FusionHunter, FusionMap, FusionFinder, MapSplice, deFuse, Bellerophontes, ChimeraScan, and TopHat-fusion) to detect fusion events using synthetic and real datasets encompassing chimeras. The comparison analysis run only on synthetic data could generate misleading results since we found no counterpart on real dataset. Furthermore, most tools report a very high number of false positive chimeras. In particular, the most sensitive tool, ChimeraScan, reports a large number of false positives that we were able to significantly reduce by devising and applying two filters to remove fusions not supported by fusion junction-spanning reads or encompassing large intronic regions.<br>CONCLUSIONS: The discordant results obtained using synthetic and real datasets suggest that synthetic datasets encompassing fusion events may not fully catch the complexity of RNA-seq experiment. Moreover, fusion detection tools are still limited in sensitivity or specificity; thus, there is space for further improvement in the fusion-finder algorithms.","title":"State-of-the-art fusion-finder algorithms sensitivity and specificity","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23555082"},

Evidence suggests that some TRs are crucial for proteins with fundamental biological functions and can be associated with virulence, resistance, and infectious/neurodegenerative diseases. Genome-scale systematic studies of TRs have the potential to unveil core mechanisms governing TR evolution and TR roles in shaping genomes. However, TR-related studies are often non-trivial due to heterogeneous and sometimes fast evolving TR regions. In this review, we discuss these intricacies and their consequences. We present our recent contributions to computational and statistical approaches for TR significance testing, sequence profile-based TR annotation, TR-aware sequence alignment, phylogenetic analyses of TR unit number and order, and TR benchmarks. Importantly, all these methods explicitly rely on the evolutionary definition of a tandem repeat as a sequence of adjacent repeat units stemming from a common ancestor. The discussed work has a focus on protein TRs, yet is generally applicable to nucleic acid TRs, sharing similar features.","title":"Statistical approaches to detecting and analyzing tandem repeats in genomic sequences","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25853125"},

TMA data are rather challenging to analyze. Covariates are highly skewed, non-normal, and may be highly correlated.

We use nonparametric bootstrap methods to validate model fitting indices such as the concordance index. We also present data mining methods for characterizing high risk patients with simple biomarker rules. Since researchers in the TMA community routinely dichotomize biomarker expression values, survival trees are a natural choice.

A number of data collection and processing strategies have been described for the implementation of quantitative PCR. However, they can be experimentally cumbersome, their relative performances have not been evaluated systematically, and they often remain poorly validated statistically and/or experimentally. In this study, we evaluated the performance of known methods, and compared them with newly developed data processing strategies in terms of resolution, precision and robustness.<br>RESULTS: Our results indicate that simple methods that do not rely on the estimation of the efficiency of the PCR amplification may provide reproducible and sensitive data, but that they do not quantify DNA with precision. Other evaluated methods based on sigmoidal or exponential curve fitting were generally of both poor resolution and precision. A statistical analysis of the parameters that influence efficiency indicated that it depends mostly on the selected amplicon and to a lesser extent on the particular biological sample analyzed. Thus, we devised various strategies based on individual or averaged efficiency values, which were used to assess the regulated expression of several genes in response to a growth factor.<br>CONCLUSION: Overall, qPCR data analysis methods differ significantly in their performance, and this analysis identifies methods that provide DNA quantification estimates of high precision, robustness and reliability. These methods allow reliable estimations of relative expression ratio of two-fold or higher, and our analysis provides an estimation of the number of biological samples that have to be analyzed to achieve a given precision.","title":"Statistical significance of quantitative PCR","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17445280"},

{"description":"Authors: Redfern, O., Grant, A., Maibaum, M., and Orengo, C.<br><br>Abstract: The last two decades have witnessed significant expansions in the databases storing information on the sequences and structures of proteins. This has led to the creation of many excellent protein family resources, which classify proteins according to their evolutionary relationship. These have allowed extensive insights into evolution and particularly how protein function mutates and evolves over time. Such analyses have greatly assisted the inheritance of functional annotations between experimentally characterised and uncharacterised genes. Moreover, the development of bioinformatics tools acts as a companion to the new technologies emerging in biology, such as transcriptomics and proteomics. The latter enable researchers to analyse gene expression profiles and interactions on a genome-wide scale, generating vast datasets of proteins, many of which include experimentally uncharacterised proteins. Protein family/function databases can be used to help interpret this data and allow us to benefit more fully from these technologies. This review aims to summarise the most popular sequence- and structure-based protein family databases. We also cover their application to comparative genomics and the functional annotation of the genomes.","title":"Survey of current protein family databases and their application in comparative, structural and functional genomics","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15652801"},

Using Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells, we generated ChIP-seq data sets for a site-specific transcription factor (Suppressor of Hairy-wing) and a histone modification (H3K36me3). We detected a chromatin-state bias: open chromatin regions yielded higher coverage, which led to false positives if not corrected. This bias had a greater effect on detection specificity than any base-composition bias. Paired-end sequencing revealed that single-end data underestimated ChIP-library complexity at high coverage. Removal of reads originating at the same base reduced false-positives but had little effect on detection sensitivity. Even at mappable-genome coverage depth of approximately 1 read per base pair, approximately 1% of the narrow peaks detected on a tiling array were missed by ChIP-seq. Evaluation of widely used ChIP-seq analysis tools suggests that adjustments or algorithm improvements are required to handle data sets with deep coverage.","title":"Systematic evaluation of factors influencing ChIP-seq fidelity","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22522655"},

A critical step in RNA-seq data analysis is the alignment of partial transcript reads to a reference genome sequence. To assess the performance of current mapping software, we invited developers of RNA-seq aligners to process four large human and mouse RNA-seq data sets. In total, we compared 26 mapping protocols based on 11 programs and pipelines and found major performance differences between methods on numerous benchmarks, including alignment yield, basewise accuracy, mismatch and gap placement, exon junction discovery and suitability of alignments for transcript reconstruction. We observed concordant results on real and simulated RNA-seq data, confirming the relevance of the metrics employed. Future developments in RNA-seq alignment methods would benefit from improved placement of multimapped reads, balanced utilization of existing gene annotation and a reduced false discovery rate for splice junctions.","title":"Systematic evaluation of spliced alignment programs for RNA-seq data","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24185836"},

{"description":"Authors: Desai, D.V., and Kulkarni-Kale, U.<br><br>Abstract: The scientific community is overwhelmed by the voluminous increase in the quantum of data on biological systems, including but not limited to the immune system. Consequently, immunoinformatics databases are continually being developed to accommodate this ever increasing data and analytical tools are continually being developed to analyze the same. Therefore, researchers are now equipped with numerous databases, analytical and prediction tools, in anticipation of better means of prevention of and therapeutic intervention in diseases of humans and other animals. Epitope is a part of an antigen, recognized either by B- or T-cells and/or molecules of the host immune system. Since only a few amino acid residues that comprise an epitope (instead of the whole protein) are sufficient to elicit an immune response, attempts are being made to identify or predict this critical stretch or patch of amino acid residues, i.e., T-cell epitopes and B-cell epitopes to be included in multiple-subunit vaccines. T-cell epitope prediction is a challenge owing to the high degree of MHC polymorphism and disparity in the volume of data on various steps encountered in the generation and presentation of T-cell epitopes in the living systems. Many algorithms/methods developed to predict T-cell epitopes and Web servers incorporating the same are available. These are based on approaches like considering amphipathicity profiles of proteins, sequence motifs, quantitative matrices (QM), artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) and molecular docking simulations, etc. This chapter aims to introduce the reader to the principle(s) underlying some of these methods/algorithms as well as procedural and practical aspects of using the same.","title":"T-cell epitope prediction methods: an overview","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25048134"},

As more genomes are sequenced, less time can be spent manually annotating those genomes, resulting in an increased reliance on automatic annotation pipelines. However, automatic pipelines can produce inaccurate genome annotation and their results often require manual curation. Here, we discuss the automatic and manual annotation of bacterial genomes, identify common problems introduced by the current genome annotation process and suggests potential solutions.","title":"The automatic annotation of bacterial genomes","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22408191"},

{"description":"Authors: Tsuang, D.W., Millard, S.P., Ely, B., Chi, P., Wang, K., Raskind, W.H., Kim, S., Brkanac, Z., and Yu, C.E.<br><br>Abstract: BACKGROUND: The detection of copy number variants (CNVs) and the results of CNV-disease association studies rely on how CNVs are defined, and because array-based technologies can only infer CNVs, CNV-calling algorithms can produce vastly different findings. Several authors have noted the large-scale variability between CNV-detection methods, as well as the substantial false positive and false negative rates associated with those methods. In this study, we use variations of four common algorithms for CNV detection (PennCNV, QuantiSNP, HMMSeg, and cnvPartition) and two definitions of overlap (any overlap and an overlap of at least 40% of the smaller CNV) to illustrate the effects of varying algorithms and definitions of overlap on CNV discovery.<br>METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used a 56 K Illumina genotyping array enriched for CNV regions to generate hybridization intensities and allele frequencies for 48 Caucasian schizophrenia cases and 48 age-, ethnicity-, and gender-matched control subjects. No algorithm found a difference in CNV burden between the two groups. However, the total number of CNVs called ranged from 102 to 3,765 across algorithms. The mean CNV size ranged from 46 kb to 787 kb, and the average number of CNVs per subject ranged from 1 to 39. The number of novel CNVs not previously reported in normal subjects ranged from 0 to 212.<br>CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Motivated by the availability of multiple publicly available genome-wide SNP arrays, investigators are conducting numerous analyses to identify putative additional CNVs in complex genetic disorders. However, the number of CNVs identified in array-based studies, and whether these CNVs are novel or valid, will depend on the algorithm(s) used. Thus, given the variety of methods used, there will be many false positives and false negatives. Both guidelines for the identification of CNVs inferred from high-density arrays and the establishment of a gold standard for validation of CNVs are needed.","title":"The effect of algorithms on copy number variant detection","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21209939"},
{"description":"Authors: Gurdeniz, G., Kristensen, M., Skov, T., and Dragsted, L.O.<br><br>Abstract: The metabolic composition of plasma is affected by time passed since the last meal and by individual variation in metabolite clearance rates. Rat plasma in fed and fasted states was analyzed with liquid chromatography quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF) for an untargeted investigation of these metabolite patterns. The dataset was used to investigate the effect of data preprocessing on biomarker selection using three different softwares, MarkerLynxTM, MZmine, XCMS along with a customized preprocessing method that performs binning of m/z channels followed by summation through retention time. Direct comparison of selected features representing the fed or fasted state showed large differences between the softwares. Many false positive markers were obtained from custom data preprocessing compared with dedicated softwares while MarkerLynxTM provided better coverage of markers. However, marker selection was more reliable with the gap filling (or peak finding) algorithms present in MZmine and XCMS. Further identification of the putative markers revealed that many of the differences between the markers selected were due to variations in features representing adducts or daughter ions of the same metabolites or of compounds from the same chemical subclasses, e.g., lyso-phosphatidylcholines (LPCs) and lyso-phosphatidylethanolamines (LPEs). We conclude that despite considerable differences in the performance of the preprocessing tools we could extract the same biological information by any of them. Carnitine, branched-chain amino acids, LPCs and LPEs were identified by all methods as markers of the fed state whereas acetylcarnitine was abundant during fasting in rats.","title":"The Effect of LC-MS Data Preprocessing Methods on the Selection of Plasma Biomarkers in Fed vs. Fasted Rats","url":"http://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/2/1/77"},

Then, their role becomes crucial in the areas of biomarkers and therapeutic targets investigation. High-throughput sequencing technologies combined with sophisticated bioinformatics tools might facilitate the discovery of such aberrations. A significant number of bioinformatics algorithms have been developed to detect fusion genes. Detection strategies are quite variegated. In this review, we inspect the strategy of 18 fusion-finder algorithms to understand how these tools call chimeras.<br>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this review, we considered 18 tools which, to the best of our knowledge, are the current state-of-the-art chimera detection tools.<br>RESULTS: The considered tools can be classified according to their alignment strategies into four different macro-groups as follows: whole paired-end, paired-end + fragmentation, direct fragmentation and statistical read distribution. The first two techniques require paired-end reads because they exploit encompassing reads during the first alignment phase, while the last two can be applied on both the read formats.<br>CONCLUSION: There is still some work to be done in the area of chimeras detection, especially concerning the definition of common benchmarks and increased specificity.","title":"The structure of state-of-art gene fusion-finder algorithms","url":"https://www.oapublishinglondon.com/article/617#"},

In particular, NGS technologies have been recently applied with great success to the discovery of mutations associated with the growth of various tumours and in rare Mendelian diseases. The advance in NGS technologies has also created significant challenges in bioinformatics. One of the major challenges is quality control of the sequencing data. In this review, we discuss the proper quality control procedures and parameters for Illumina technology-based human DNA re-sequencing at three different stages of sequencing: raw data, alignment and variant calling. Monitoring quality control metrics at each of the three stages of NGS data provides unique and independent evaluations of data quality from differing perspectives. Properly conducting quality control protocols at all three stages and correctly interpreting the quality control results are crucial to ensure a successful and meaningful study.","title":"Three-stage quality control strategies for DNA re-sequencing data","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24067931"},

{"description":"Authors: Pahikkala, T., Airola, A., Pietila, S., Shakyawar, S., Szwajda, A., Tang, J., and Aittokallio, T.<br><br>Abstract: A number of supervised machine learning models have recently been introduced for the prediction of drug-target interactions based on chemical structure and genomic sequence information. Although these models could offer improved means for many network pharmacology applications, such as repositioning of drugs for new therapeutic uses, the prediction models are often being constructed and evaluated under overly simplified settings that do not reflect the real-life problem in practical applications. Using quantitative drug-target bioactivity assays for kinase inhibitors, as well as a popular benchmarking data set of binary drug-target interactions for enzyme, ion channel, nuclear receptor and G protein-coupled receptor targets, we illustrate here the effects of four factors that may lead to dramatic differences in the prediction results: (i) problem formulation (standard binary classification or more realistic regression formulation), (ii) evaluation data set (drug and target families in the application use case), (iii) evaluation procedure (simple or nested cross-validation) and (iv) experimental setting (whether training and test sets share common drugs and targets, only drugs or targets or neither). Each of these factors should be taken into consideration to avoid reporting overoptimistic drug-target interaction prediction results. We also suggest guidelines on how to make the supervised drug-target interaction prediction studies more realistic in terms of such model formulations and evaluation setups that better address the inherent complexity of the prediction task in the practical applications, as well as novel benchmarking data sets that capture the continuous nature of the drug-target interactions for kinase inhibitors.","title":"Toward more realistic drug-target interaction predictions","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24723570"},

We reviewed the biomedical literature for translational platforms allowing the management and exploration of clinical and omics data, and identified seven platforms: BRISK, caTRIP, cBio Cancer Portal, G-DOC, iCOD, iDASH and tranSMART. We analyzed these platforms along seven major axes. (1) The community axis regrouped information regarding initiators and funders of the project, as well as availability status and references. (2) We regrouped under the information content axis the nature of the clinical and omics data handled by each system. (3) The privacy management environment axis encompassed functionalities allowing control over data privacy. (4) In the analysis support axis, we detailed the analytical and statistical tools provided by the platforms. We also explored (5) interoperability support and (6) system requirements. The final axis (7) platform support listed the availability of documentation and installation procedures. A large heterogeneity was observed in regard to the capability to manage phenotype information in addition to omics data, their security and interoperability features. The analytical and visualization features strongly depend on the considered platform. Similarly, the availability of the systems is variable.

The massively parallel sequencing approach can detect low-frequency mutations and it provides a snapshot of the entire virus population. However, analyzing ultra-deep sequencing data obtained from diverse virus populations is challenging because of PCR and sequencing errors and short read lengths, such that the experiment provides only indirect evidence of the underlying viral population structure. Recent computational and statistical advances allow for accommodating some of the confounding factors, including methods for read error correction, haplotype reconstruction, and haplotype frequency estimation. With these methods ultra-deep sequencing can be more reliably used to analyze, in a quantitative manner, the genetic diversity of virus populations.","title":"Ultra-deep sequencing for the analysis of viral populations","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22440844"},

The main strength of T-Coffee is its ability to combine third party aligners and to integrate structural (or homology) information when building MSAs. The series of protocols presented here show how the package can be used to multiply align proteins, RNA and DNA sequences. The protein section shows how users can select the most suitable T-Coffee mode for their data set. Detailed protocols include T-Coffee, the default mode, M-Coffee, a meta version able to combine several third party aligners into one, PSI (position-specific iterated)-Coffee, the homology extended mode suitable for remote homologs and Expresso, the structure-based multiple aligner. We then also show how the T-RMSD (tree based on root mean square deviation) option can be used to produce a functionally informative structure-based clustering. RNA alignment procedures are described for using R-Coffee, a mode able to use predicted RNA secondary structures when aligning RNA sequences. DNA alignments are illustrated with Pro-Coffee, a multiple aligner specific of promoter regions. We also present some of the many reformatting utilities bundled with T-Coffee.

Several new bioinformatics tools have been developed for calling sequence variants from NGS data. Here, we validate the variant calling of these tools and compare their relative accuracy to determine which data processing pipeline is optimal.<br>RESULTS: We developed a unified pipeline for processing NGS data that encompasses four modules: mapping, filtering, realignment and recalibration, and variant calling. We processed 130 subjects from an ongoing whole exome sequencing study through this pipeline. To evaluate the accuracy of each module, we conducted a series of comparisons between the single nucleotide variant (SNV) calls from the NGS data and either gold-standard Sanger sequencing on a total of 700 variants or array genotyping data on a total of 9,935 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. A head to head comparison showed that Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) provided more accurate calls than SAMtools (positive predictive value of 92.55% vs. 80.35%, respectively). Realignment of mapped reads and recalibration of base quality scores before SNV calling proved to be crucial to accurate variant calling. GATK HaplotypeCaller algorithm for variant calling outperformed the UnifiedGenotype algorithm. We also showed a relationship between mapping quality, read depth and allele balance, and SNV call accuracy. However, if best practices are used in data processing, then additional filtering based on these metrics provides little gains and accuracies of &gt;99% are achievable.<br>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings will help to determine the best approach for processing NGS data to confidently call variants for downstream analyses. To enable others to implement and replicate our results, all of our codes are freely available at http://metamoodics.org/wes.","title":"Validation and assessment of variant calling pipelines for next-generation sequencing","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25078893"},

{"description":"Authors: Liu, X., Han, S., Wang, Z., Gelernter, J., and Yang, B.Z.<br><br>Abstract: Next generation sequencing (NGS) has been leading the genetic study of human disease into an era of unprecedented productivity. Many bioinformatics pipelines have been developed to call variants from NGS data. The performance of these pipelines depends crucially on the variant caller used and on the calling strategies implemented. We studied the performance of four prevailing callers, SAMtools, GATK, glftools and Atlas2, using single-sample and multiple-sample variant-calling strategies. Using the same aligner, BWA, we built four single-sample and three multiple-sample calling pipelines and applied the pipelines to whole exome sequencing data taken from 20 individuals. We obtained genotypes generated by Illumina Infinium HumanExome v1.1 Beadchip for validation analysis and then used Sanger sequencing as a \"gold-standard\" method to resolve discrepancies for selected regions of high discordance. Finally, we compared the sensitivity of three of the single-sample calling pipelines using known simulated whole genome sequence data as a gold standard. Overall, for single-sample calling, the called variants were highly consistent across callers and the pairwise overlapping rate was about 0.9. Compared with other callers, GATK had the highest rediscovery rate (0.9969) and specificity (0.99996), and the Ti/Tv ratio out of GATK was closest to the expected value of 3.02. Multiple-sample calling increased the sensitivity. Results from the simulated data suggested that GATK outperformed SAMtools and glfSingle in sensitivity, especially for low coverage data. Further, for the selected discrepant regions evaluated by Sanger sequencing, variant genotypes called by exome sequencing versus the exome array were more accurate, although the average variant sensitivity and overall genotype consistency rate were as high as 95.87% and 99.82%, respectively. In conclusion, GATK showed several advantages over other variant callers for general purpose NGS analyses. The GATK pipelines we developed perform very well.","title":"Variant callers for next-generation sequencing data: a comparison study","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24086590"},

The modelling and concomitant simulation render it possible to predict the cellular behaviour of systems under various genetically and/or environmentally perturbed conditions. This motivates systems biologists/bioengineers/bioinformaticians to develop new tools and applications, allowing non-experts to easily conduct such modelling and analysis. However, among a multitude of systems biology tools developed to date, only a handful of projects have adopted a web-based approach to kinetic modelling. In this report, we evaluate the capabilities and characteristics of current web-based tools in systems biology and identify desirable features, limitations and bottlenecks for further improvements in terms of usability and functionality. A short discussion on software architecture issues involved in web-based applications and the approaches taken by existing tools is included for those interested in developing their own simulation applications.","title":"Web-based applications for building, managing and analysing kinetic models of biological systems","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18805901"},
