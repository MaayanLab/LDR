The LINCS Data Registry, found at http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/LDR, is a home for centers to submit their data release instances in a consistent and controlled format. On the homepage (shown below) you'll notice a display of releases. These releases are in order of released first and then by release date. They can be searched by group/center name or assay name. There is also a username and password form for logging in at the top. The username and password for your center is:

**username**: hmsadmin  
**password**: hmsL24

After logging in, you may change your username and password. If you would like different members of your center to register as different users, clicking the *register* button on the homepage will bring you to a registration page, where you will be able to sign up and join groups that already exist (such as your own) or make a new one.

Once logged in, you'll notice the navigation bar has changed. The image below describes where each button leads.

The overview page, shown below, is where you'll find the releases you have already entered into the system. This table can be sorted by any of the fields with a blue label. The legend at the top shows the four possible statuses for your release. If you make a new data release instance or edit an existing one, the release will need to be approved by the NIH, and the *Awaiting approval* label will be applied. If and when approved, the *Approved* label will be applied and it will be displayed on the homepage. If the NIH decides that something is not correct with your release instance, they will return it to you with a message explaining why. This message will be available for you to read and a *Needs Attention* label will be added. If your instance has been approved and the data becomes available, you will be able to release it. Note that **along with needing approval, a data URL is required in order to release an instance**. Editing, deleting, viewing messages, and releasing dataset instances can be done using the *Action* dropdown. Finally, the plus button shown on the right side of the display table will allow you to expand the entry, showing all of the associated meta-data.

Under the *Dataset Releases* dropdown in the navigation bar, you'll find an *Add New* option. This will bring you to the Dataset Registration Form. Here you'll find a form with all the fields you need to enter a dataset release instance. As you'll notice in the image below, some fields are required and many of the fields have autocomplete functionality. The meta-data available in these autocomplete fields is maintained by the DCIC and more will become available over the course of the curation and standardization process currently being done.

The User Settings page allows the user to change information about themselves and their profile, including their username and password. As for the Center/Group homepage, the group's name, description, and icon can be changed. In addition, the statistics of the group and current users are shown. If a new member has a registered and would like to join your group, they will appear here. Any admitted members are allowed to edit group information and admit other users.
