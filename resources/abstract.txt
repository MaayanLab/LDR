In order for a LINCS Data and Signature Generation Center (DSGC) to release a dataset in the NIH LINCS Program, they must go through the slow process of exchanging several spreadsheets and emails with the NIH in order to receive approval for their dataset and negotiate its release dates. This time-consuming process lacks uniformity, proving to be a difficult task for the NIH. We present the LINCS Dataset Registry to tackle this traditional process. A modern, mobile-friendly web application, the LINCS Dataset Registry, or LDR, streamlines the process of submitting, approving, and releasing a dataset in the NIH LINCS Program. It consists of a client-side application created with the Javascript library AngularJS and an web server written in NodeJS. The server's extensive API's communicate to a MongoDB database responsible for storing and querying each center's data. Its login functionality allows enables security of unreleased datasets and its advanced input forms allow for fast, hassle-free data entry. From entity autocompletion to a dataset-specific message board between DSGCs and the NIH, LDR improves productivity for DSGCs and brings consistency to the NIH's approval process.
