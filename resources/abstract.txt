In order for a LINCS Data and Signature Generation Center (DSGC) to release a dataset in the NIH LINCS Program, they must go through the slow process of exchanging several spreadsheets and emails with the NIH in order to receive approval for their dataset and negotiate its release dates. This time-consuming process lacks uniformity, proving to be a difficult task for the NIH. We present the LINCS Dataset Registry to tackle this traditional process. A modern, mobile-friendly web application, the LINCS Dataset Registry, or LDR, streamlines the process of submitting, approving, and releasing a dataset in the NIH LINCS Program. From entity autocompletion to a dataset-specific message board between DSGCs and the NIH, the LINCS Dataset Registry, or LDR, improves productivity for DSGCs and brings consistency to the NIH's approval process.
