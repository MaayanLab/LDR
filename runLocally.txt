Instructions on running lincsproject locally

1. Unzip the lincsproject.zip file.
2. Install nodejs by visiting https://nodejs.org/. This will install npm on your machine.
3. Open up a terminal and change directories into the folder that was unzipped from step 1.
4. Run the following commands (These will take a decent amount of time to complete):
  - npm install -g gulp bower
  - npm install
  - bower install
5. After that, all dependencies will be installed. From the same directory in your terminal,
run "gulp" (without the quotes) and the application should be built and even opened in your browser. If not, you may find it at http://localhost:3001/lincsproject
